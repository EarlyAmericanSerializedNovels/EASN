### Preface  

*A Journey to Philadelphia, or, Memoirs of Charles Coleman Saunders* was first serialized in *The Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register* in 1804. The initial installment appeared on April 14, and the novel ran in six subsequent issues, ending May 19. The author signed the novel simply “Adelio.” The pseudonym is a masculine derivation of the German *edel,* which translates to noble. In addition to *A Journey to Philadelphia,* Adelio is named as author of 12 other poems and opinion letters in the magazine. One poem is written in German, and translated by another contributor, others written in English. His contributions present a range of topics, including marriage, linguistics, law, German poetry in translation, and nature. All Adelio’s contributions were published in 1804, and several were in the same issues in which *A Journey to Philadelphia* appeared.

*The Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register* was a Philadelphia-based weekly magazine which was published from 1800-1805. According to its terms, a subscription cost four dollars per year, and half that for subscribers in the country outside Philadelphia. Women’s interests were frequent topics in the magazine. According to Lucia McMahon’s study of female roles in American society, venues like *The Philadelphia Repository* expanded the network of communication in order to propagate and advocate for women’s education. *The Philadelphia Repository* was a miscellany, committed to publishing a variety of topics, so it is unsurprising the editors would publish pieces which contributed to the national conversation of women’s roles in the nascent republic.

Adelio’s contributions are not excluded from the conversations on women. In one April 7, 1804 Adelio letter, a case is made against men who bemoan their wives. He warns readers against choosing a marriage partner for beauty and fortune only.

> Let those who write against marriage, pause, and reflect--let them
> enquire with care, listen candidly, and decide impartially, and I am
> much mistaken, if they do not find themselves erring in a most
> egregious manner; they will find, that where there are unhappy
> couples, it has as frequently been owing to an improper choice; in
> many instances the female has been selected for beauty of fortune
> only, without any regard to disposition, virtue, or solid
> accomplishments.

In other words, Adelio echoes other writers of the Early National period by advocating for a filial marriage pairing instead of marriage for financial gain. The April 7 letter sparks a response from L’ami, another contributor, who disagrees with Adelio’s forgiving stance toward women in unhappy marriages. L’ami instead blames incessant female chatter, financial excess, and domineering female spirits to marital strife. Adelio responds by reproaching the writer, and suggesting he read more closely in order to fully understand his points.

In another entry, Adelio claims a motto, initially in German, then translated to English. “When you write, write so your reader may understand." Following the German heading, Adelio’s article is a denouncement of foreign language mottos or headings, and he describes them, in essence, as pretentious displays of education.

Varied articles like Adelio’s are common to *The Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register*. As a miscellany, the magazine ran various entries, including essays, fiction, birth and death announcements, poetry, biographical sketches, theatre information, and music. It was also known to re-print and re-run previous material or material from other periodicals. Edited first by David Hogan, successive editors were John W. Scott and Thomas Irwin. In 1802, the magazine was suspended from July to October due to the Yellow Fever epidemic in Philadelphia.

*A Journey to Philadelphia’s* protagonist, Charles Coleman Saunders, an idealistic youth from the countryside north of Philadelphia. Saunders, while in search for his trade, is arrested for a murder he witnessed, but did not commit. The true culprit is his double in almost every way, a Freudian *unheimlich.* The double, whose name is Carson, attempts a crime due to an unhappy marriage. The stranger’s doubling represents Saunders’ options to choose an unhappy marriage and suffer the consequences, or to choose well and be happy. Emila represents a good marriage pairing, while the marriage of Saunders’ double represents what can happen if prudence and wisdom is not exercised in romantic pursuits.

In another subplot, Charles Saunders, like protagonists in Charles Brockden Brown’s *Wieland* (1798), faces trials at the hands of a malicious villain, one who threatens his existence and happiness. Like Brown’s Carwin, Carnell has insights to Saunders’ life, his home, and his closest friends. Saunders cannot rid himself of the villain, but unlike Brown’s novel, Saunders’ wrongful conviction shields him from Carnell, while Brown’s Wieland family (of German descent) falls to madness and violence. *The Journey to Philadelphia’s* parallels to other popular texts at the time suggests the influence of those works on the writer, and provides ample evidence for the short novel as a gothic tale.

Shortly after its appearance in *The Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register, A Journey to Philadelphia* was collected and published as a book by publishers Lincoln and Gleason in 1804. Included in the book was *An Interesting Narrative,* another short, anonymously printed tale. That *A Journey to Philadelphia* was collected and sold as a text so soon after its initial publication suggests its popularity.

*AN ORIGINAL TALE-- BY ADELIO.*  
  
A  
  
JOURNEY TO PHILADELPHIA:  
  
OR,  
  
MEMOIRS  
  
OF  
  
CHARLES COLEMAN SAUNDERS.  
  
\[1. 14 April 1804\]  
  
SOME time in the year--, I fre-  
quently visit the prison at Philadelphia,  
for no other purpose than to satisfy curi-  
osity, in one of which visits, I noticed a  
man sitting in a retired part: Something  
in his appearance made me wish for a  
nearer view, to accomplish my purpose,  
I resolved to address him and offer such  
little services, as I knew were agreeable to  
persons in his situation; his counten-  
ance was remarkably interesting, it bore  
the traces of sorrow resisted by a manly  
fortitude; his dress was plain in a much  
greater degree, than was common for  
persons at his age (he appeared about  
twenty;) his manners were mild and pre-  
possessing, and his conversation plainly  
evinced that he possessed no common  
share of intelligence; I afterwards fre-  
quently visited him in his prison and did  
him any little services my power: -- I  
would describe his character; but this  
will be better done, representing the fol-  
lowing memoirs of him, written by him-  
self.  
  
TO you my friend who have not  
suffered appearances to make you impen-  
etrable to the voice of truth; and whose  
humanity has alleviated the miseries of  
my situation; I will relate the adven-  
tures of my life; you will find them singu-  
lar and unfortunate, and it will require  
an exertion of all your candor to enable  
you to give credit to the relation; -- but  
I have now no motive, even if I had the  
inclination, to deceive you; I shall short-  
ly suffer the punishment due to the crime  
of which I have been convicted, if you  
think he who is standing on the verge of  
eternity, and deeply impressed with a  
proper sense of his situation, will not de-  
ceive you, you will give my story a pa-  
tient and accredited hearing.  
  
The first part of my life was passed on  
the banks of the Susquehanna in Penn-  
Sylvania; my father had retired to this  
place to pass his days in the quiet of an  
agricultural life: He was one, who, like  
myself, had early struggled in the thorny  
paths of adversity and misfortune; he  
had once filled a station better suited to  
his talents and industry, and it was chief-  
ly from this excellent being I received  
the little knowledge I have acquired; but  
on this is unnecessary to dwell:-- Pro-  
fiting by his instructions, and aided by  
a disposition to enquire into the causes  
of all I saw in the works of nature and  
art, and generally to add to my fund of  
knowledge, I early contracted an aver-  
sion to the dull uniform, and as I then  
thought, uninstructive round of pursuits  
which mark the progress of an agricultu-  
ral life; I sought to distinguish myself  
by becoming eminently useful to man-  
kind; I had read of men who, with no  
unusual talents, but by a proper exertion  
of them, had become celebrated for some  
singular services they had performed;  
and why, thought I, could not I, like  
them become distinguished; the path of  
fame was open to all who have the cour-  
age to tread it; could I not, by application  
and a strenuous exertion of my powers  
give my ideas a greater expansion? If I  
reflected on what I saw, what I did, and  
what was done by others, would it not at  
last lead me to the accomplishment of my  
wishes? There were various methods  
by which I might acquire celebrity and  
honor; in the field, in the cabinet, in the  
study of the arts and sciences; for the  
first I had neither inclination nor taste,  
my disposition was peaceable, I possessed  
none of that terrible kind of courage,  
better called ferocity, which would ena-  
ble me to distinguish myself as a soldier,  
and had I possessed it, I did not enter-  
tain the idea that honest fame could be  
acquired by becoming the greatest of the  
destroyers of the human race, and an in-  
creaser of their already too numerous  
calamities.  
  
Politics pleased me as little, I thought  
it would be impossible to preserve my  
integrity, amidst the dangers and tempta-  
tions which usually surround an impor-  
tant political station, I saw that even the  
preservation of this invaluable possession  
would not perhaps eventually accomplish  
my purpose; the best of politicians had  
not all been famous for their virtue;  
even those who had preserved it untaint-  
ed, while they had been extolled by one  
party of men, had been vilified by ano-  
ther; to become celebrated in the pro-  
motion of the arts and sciences, was the  
only path left open to my footsteps, my  
success in this pursuit would displease  
no one, and the applause I might merit  
would be willingly awarded by all.  
Many of my leisure hours had been oc-  
cupied by reflections of this nature, and  
time only served to add strength to my  
resolution; I had already become ac-  
quainted with some of the principles of  
experimental philosophy, my father’s  
books had supplied me with much use-  
ful knowledge in mechanics, hydraulics,  
&c. many an unoccupied hour had been  
passed in applying my theoretical know-  
ledge to practice; I had constructed  
clocks of wood, I had made mills, pumps,  
&c. it is true, they were rude and un-  
finished, but they were my first essays  
and much could not be expected, where  
the only tools used were a saw, hatchet,  
and knife; yet my success served to add  
vigor to my ruling passion; I flattered  
myself that my little machines were con-  
structed on an improved plan, and if I  
could make improvements here, under so  
many disadvantages, what should I not  
be able to perform in the city, where  
these attempts might be made on a more  
extensive scale, and would receive the  
reward due to their merit.  
  
To go to the city became my most  
earnest wish; but my father was very  
averse to the scheme, his experience had  
taught him to believe a greater share of  
felicity was attainable in his situation,  
than in the accomplishment of the object  
of my pursuit; I knew he entertained  
this opinion and therefore resolved not to  
consult him, but to act in obedience to  
the dictates of my inclination, without  
his knowledge; it would do him no in-  
jury, my brother was a sufficient assist-  
ant in the ordinary labors of the planta-  
tion, and his circumstances enabled him  
to hire in the case of inability. -- My resolu-  
tion was taken, and I had but to put it in  
execution; a journey of a few days  
would bear me to the city: I was well  
acquainted with the roads, accustomed to  
pedestrian feats, and dreaded no danger,  
from a nightly elopement. A circum-  
stance which happened some time before,  
was an additional motive; it had been  
my delight to take a nightly ramble to a  
rock which commanded a fine view of  
the river and surrounding country, here  
I used to sit, or walk, and contemplate  
the beauties of nature, when the mild ra-  
diance of the moon displayed all the ro-  
mantic beauties of the surrounding  
scene, in its richest, though softest tints;  
nor was this my only employment, I had  
a smattering of astronomy, I could name  
most of the constellations, and loved to  
gaze over, and reflect on the innumera-  
ble glories of the heavens; returning  
from an excursion of this kind, I was  
alarmed by a cry of distress, I started--  
the natural timidity of my disposition  
gave way to the idea, that I might per-  
haps, be serviceable to some person in  
distress, the voice was that of a female,  
but from whence could it proceed? I  
knew no female would willingly be  
abroad at this solitary hour, in a country  
but thinly settled; the idea of robbers  
occurred, -- the shriek was heard again,  
it was near me; and I quickly saw a  
man attempting to bear a struggling fe-  
male from the public road; I rushed up-  
on him, -- a desperate struggle ensued,  
in which I proved victorious; mean-  
while, the lady had fled, but the momen-  
tary view I had of her features awaken-  
ed sensations of a new and unaccountable  
kind; the first wish they produced was,  
a desire to behold again, the object which  
had excited them; the man who had  
yielded to my superior strength had fled,  
I had no right to detain him, I had ac-  
complished my object; but now a new  
one occupied my attention: I hasted to  
search after the female, I searched the  
road, the wood, but in vain, she was no  
where to be found; and I returned home  
weary, dissatisfied and perplexed.  
All my enquiries with regard to the  
lady, were fruitless, -- my affairs pro-  
ceded in their wonted course for some  
time; my nocturnal rambles were con-  
tinued, and my speculations with regard  
to the future were still indulged; one  
night I was returning home from my  
favorite spot, I noticed a man crossing  
the path which led to my father’s dwell-  
ing; surprised at an appearance so un-  
common, I was endeavoring to guess  
what could induce anyone, besides my-  
self, to wander through the woods at this  
late hour; from these reflections, I was  
roused by a pistol shot, which deprived  
me for a time, of sentation[^1]; I know not  
how long I remained in this state, and  
when I recovered, found I had sustained  
but little injury; how I happened to es-  
cape so well, I know not, whether it had  
been fired from a great distance, had  
spent its force by striking against a tree,  
or been deadened by the resistance of my  
hat and a large handkerchief, which I  
had bound round my head to relieve a  
violent head-ache, I am unable to deter-  
mine; but I was happy I had received so  
small an injury.  
  
A new train of reflections and surmis-  
es were new exited; I asked myself  
who could be the person that fired; it  
was evident it was an enemy; every con-  
current circumstance, the hour, the place,  
seemed to impress this belief; but who  
would it be? I had injured no being on  
earth, I was almost a stranger (owing to  
my romantic notions) even to my nearest  
neighbors; I was totally unable to form  
any rational conjecture; I soon recover-  
ed the slight injury I had sustained; the  
circumstance no longer caused any anxi-  
ety, and I again ventured to revisit my  
favorite retreat;--returning home one  
night, as I passed through my brother’s  
chamber to gain my own, I saw by the  
light of the moon, the figure of a man  
standing near the bed of my brother,  
armed with a dagger; I stood almost pe-  
trified with fear and astonishment; I  
had imbibed from our rustic neighbors,  
some superstitious ideas, it was near,  
“the noon of night,” that solemn hour,  
when the dead forsake their graves, and  
wander forth to revisit scenes once dear  
to them; I believed I saw a spectre; I  
made no alarm, my tongue clave to the  
roof of my mouth, horror almost froze  
the blood in my veins, and my limbs  
scarcely supported my tottering frame!  
The figure moved towards me, -- I made  
a desperate effort, reached my chamber  
and locked the door; the silence of death  
reigned in the house, -- not a sound reach-  
ed my ear; I gave myself up to reflec-  
tion: could, I asked, this figure be an in-  
habitant of the grave? Was it probable  
that the dead could leave the earth, and  
rise to sport with the terrors of mankind?  
Would they come armed with the wea-  
pons of death? My reason would not  
suffer me to cherish the thought, my cou-  
rage returned, I left the room and search-  
ed the house in silence, for now I believ-  
ed it must be a robber I had seen; but I  
found no one, every thing was save, and  
returning to my bed, I puzzled myself  
with fain conjectures, till sleep wrapped  
my senses in forgetfulness.  
  
In the morning, I enquired if any noise  
had been heard in the night? And No,  
was the answer; no one had heard any  
thing, their slumbers had been sound and  
uninterrupted; I evaded answering with  
truth to the consequent enquiries, by say-  
ing I had dreamed a frightful dream.  
The next night I again saw the same  
figure, but I was now convinced it was  
no spectre, but a man; at the sight of me  
he fled, and passed through the door  
which I had by accident left unfastened;  
a new cause of wonder here presented it-  
self: who could this man be? and what  
was his object? were questions which  
naturally occurred; my father frequently  
left his bed and traversed the house in  
his sleep; but it was certain this was  
not him. By what means could he have  
entered the house? I had fastened the  
door and had the key in my pock-  
et; he was armed; this gave birth to a  
new idea; it was evident his intentions  
were dreadful; my adventure on a pre-  
ceding night was remembered; my life  
had been aimed at, and it was probable  
it was again attempted; my thoughts  
however, fixed themselves on no deter-  
minate object, until I recalled the remem-  
brance of the female whose rescue I had  
effected; that man whom I had defeat-  
ed, he then, I concluded, must be the one  
who had fired the pistol, and whom I  
twice met armed in my brother’s cham-  
ber, -- he wished to revenge himself  
on the author of his defeat, he had attempted  
to destroy my brother through mistake,  
and my appearance had alone saved his  
life. There now appeared to be an ab-  
solute necessity of taking some measures  
to counteract his schemes; and in form-  
ing plans of this nature I busied myself,  
till a new thought displaced my former  
ones. It now appeared plain to me, that  
this man had discovered his error, or  
why did he not (believing I slept in the bed  
of my brother) pierce his bosom with  
the dagger; there was nothing to pre-  
vent him, my brother was sleeping, he  
might have killed him, retired in silence,  
and the dark mantle of oblivion, would  
have hidden the secret from the know-  
ledge of man. It was now evident my  
life was attempted; he had found means  
to descend the chimney, and enter my  
brother’s chamber, as by this means only,  
he could enter mine.

\[ 2. 21 April 1804\]  
  
There is no fear which acts so  
powerfully on the mind of man, as that  
which bids him guard against no deter-  
minate object or attempt; my death was  
certainly intended. To meet it face to  
face in any form (though constitutionally  
timid) I thought possible; but to be for-  
ever in danger, to be taken off by a bullet  
while I believed myself safe, to drink the  
draught of death, when I thought myself  
restoring vigor to my exhausted frame,  
or to perish when lying defenceless and  
reposing in the arms of sleep -- these  
were dangers to encounter for which all  
my courage was unequal, and which could  
only be avoided by removing from my  
present abode; once gone, my enemy’s  
scheme of revenge would be relinquish-  
ed; if I remained, I should one time or  
other, become its victim. My journey  
to the city was again resolved upon and  
executed. At midnight I left my father’s  
house, but without any intention to re-  
turn: I took nothing with me except a  
small sum of money: I imparted my in-  
tention to no one: I may be blamed for  
leaving my friends thus abruptly, in anx-  
iety and suspense respecting my fate;  
but I thought it wrong to alarm them, as  
they could not possibly remove the cause  
of my danger; they would have persuad-  
ed me to remain, or by their means my  
future residence would be discovered,  
CARNELL (the being whom I believed to  
be my secret enemy) would pursue me,  
and I should be subject to incessant  
alarms; perhaps you may think my con-  
clusions unwarranted; if so, remember  
they were the conclusions of one, who  
was unable, from the singularity of the  
case, to receive advantages from the judg-  
ement of others.  
  
I did not, however, leave my father’s  
house without emotion, I could not de-  
ny myself the secret satisfaction of vis-  
iting every spot, which recollection made  
dear to my heart, the nocturnal seat  
was not forgotten; once more I repair-  
ed thither and seated myself in the usual  
place; -- the night was calm and clear,  
not a cloud obscured the splendors of the  
etherial vault of heaven, the moon was  
full and her beams seemed to repose on  
the tranquil bosom of the water; every  
sound was hushed, save when the zephyr  
sighed through the foliage of the venera-  
ble oaks. -- It brought to my recollection  
the celebrated night-piece of *Homer*, --  
thus translated by *Pope*:--  
  
As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,  
O’er heav’n’s clear azure casts her sacred light,  
When not a breeze disturbs the blue serene,  
And not a cloud o’ercasts the solemn scene;  
Around her throne the vivid planets roll,  
And stars unnumber’d gild the glowing pole;  
O’er the dark trees a yellower lustre shed,  
And tip with silver ev’ry mountain’s head.--  
Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise;  
A flood of glory bursts from all the skies;  
The conscious swains exulting in the sight,  
Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.  
  
To me who was about to leave it, per-  
haps forever, this scene appeared unusu-  
ally interesting; I knew not how long I  
sat occupied with various reflections,  
when I was roused by the sound of ap-  
proaching footsteps; I started, and look-  
ed around, I saw a young woman at no  
great distance from me, in her hand she  
held an open letter; her movements were  
wild, irregular, she would look on the  
letter, and then on heaven; I watched  
her with attention and solicitude; the  
adventure was of a singular nature; this  
was a place not frequented by any human  
being except myself, at least I had not  
seen any one here at this hour. Could  
she be seeking any one here! This  
seemed improbable, and her attention  
seemed wholly absorbed by the letter. –  
Suddenly she exclaimed, I can bear this  
torture no longer, rushed towards  
the river; I started from my seat, and  
flew to prevent her; I seized her but she  
eluded my grasp, shrieked, and leaped  
into the water! In a moment all was  
again silent; to descend to the river at  
this spot, could not be accomplished  
without immanent risk; I looked down  
on the stream, but the overhanging rocks  
cast a deep shade over it, and I saw her  
no more: Some distressing occurrence  
had probably overpowered her reason,  
and in a moment of despair and insani-  
ty she had put an end to her existence;  
she had chosen the hour of midnight for  
this purpose, when she thought the deed  
would be concealed from every human  
eye; I however, had been a melancholy  
witness to the shocking catastrophe.  
Her friends would wonder whither she  
had fled – I only could tell; her corse  
would be borne down the stream, it  
would perhaps be found when corruption  
had made the features indistinguisha-  
ble; conjectures would be formed as to  
who it had been, and how it came there;  
and I alone, could answer all these ques-  
tions; but should I endeavor to discover  
who it was, should I inform her friends,  
what had been her fate; I should be  
seized as the perpetrator of the deed: I  
might indeed discover the truth, but  
they would not believe it; I should suf-  
fer by my sincerity, I should at least be  
blamed for not preventing it; this I  
might have done, but how was I to ima-  
gine her intention? Self-destruction was  
a deed of which I thought mankind in-  
capable, and when convinced of the con-  
trary, it was too late -- the deed was  
done; the past could not be recalled. I  
resolved to leave every thing to its  
course; no one had witnessed her end  
but myself, and I would, for many re-  
asons, be induced to conceal it, her  
friends would be benefited by this pro-  
cedure, they would suppose her death,  
(if the intelligence of it reached them) ac-  
cidental, and be spared the dreadful cer-  
tainty of its being intentionally effected.  
I pursued my journey, and reached the  
city in safety; here new difficulties pre-  
sented themselves; my object had been  
to offer myself as an apprentice to a  
watchmaker; but who would take me?  
I was acquainted with no human being,  
though surrounded by so many thou-  
sands, I was unknown and unrecommend-  
ded; in the mean time I might be ap-  
prehended as a thief, or confined as a  
vagrant or runaway; this might be pre-  
vented by a disclosure of the truth, but  
its concealment was necessary to my pur-  
pose; in addition to this, food was abso-  
lutely necessary; my stock of money  
was almost exhausted.  
  
Those who have lived remote from  
cities, have not a just conception of the  
real necessity of money; provisions for  
a day, lodgings for a night, might be had  
in many parts of the country gratis, and  
would be received as the offering of hos-  
pitality, a virtue more practised in the  
country, than in town: The little cash I  
had yet remaining would not, here, pur-  
chase more food than was necessary for  
a single meal; the haughty indepen-  
dence of my spirit would not permit me  
to ask a favor, and my soul revolted at  
the thought of stealing; I shuddered  
when I reflected on the condition to  
which my imprudence had reduced me;  
a secret voice whispered, “you have  
done wrong;” but to return was too late,  
and the evils I had fled from would again  
be encountered; my situation was sim-  
ilar to that of a man in the midst of a  
rapid stream; it was at least as easy to  
proceed as to return, my course was  
pointed out, and I could do nothing  
more than rush on boldly to the endur-  
ance of whatever ills I was doomed to  
suffer.  
  
I knocked at the door of a watchmaker  
in market-street, and was soon ushered  
into the room, where sat the master and  
his family, in a manner which plainly  
evinced my embarrassment; I told him  
my business; his dark, unprepossessing  
features were contracted, and his pene-  
trating eyes seemed to pierce my  
very soul: He asked my name, place of  
abode, &c. I told him no falsehoods,  
neither did I tell him the whole truth; I  
did not tell him my father’s dislike to my  
pursuit; after much conversation of an  
uninteresting nature, he said, “your sto-  
ry does not seem improbable, your ap-  
pearance seems to evince the truth of  
some parts of it, but if I take you as an  
apprentice, what security can you give  
me, for your good conduct, and indus-  
try.” All I have to give, I replied, is the  
word of a man of honor, who values his  
word too highly, to promise what he  
does not intend to perform. The term,  
I believe sounded strangely in his ears,  
it was indeed ludicrously contrasted  
with my homely dress, and awkward ap-  
pearance, and I believe he was about to  
refuse me, when the entrance of a young  
lady put an end to this interval of sus-  
pense, and created another; she cast an  
enquiring look upon me; I felt still  
more distressed, and held down my head,  
confused and confounded, when a sud-  
den exclamation from her, of “Can it be  
possible?” effectually roused me, “can  
what be possible?” said every one in the  
same instant; she answered not, but hast-  
ening to me, she seized my hand; I was  
now convinced my conjectures were  
right; when she spoke, I thought the  
voice familiar to my ear, at least that I  
had somewhere heard it before; a sight  
of her features told me where, my hand  
trembled in hers, and I flattered myself  
she was not without emotion: You have,  
no doubt, already guessed who this lady  
was, you will remember my adventure  
in the wood when I saved her from the  
violence of CARNELL: An explanation  
ensued, and I received the thanks of her  
family; my first request was granted,  
and I became an apprentice.

\[ 3. 28 April 1804\]  
  
TIME rolled rapidly along; my  
exertions pleased Mr. BRANART; my  
knowledge increased; my reading, and  
conversation with man, enlarged my  
mind, whilst it corrected many of my er-  
rors; my hopes of distinction were raised,  
I thought I saw the path of fame open as I  
travelled: Mean time my leisure hours  
were passed in the society of the amiable  
EMILIA BRANART, the first impressions  
which I had felt at the sight of her, were  
strengthened and confirmed; nor did I  
think her opinion of me unfavorable, and  
I believed I should have no cause to re-  
pent my journey.  
  
But this pleasing calm, this feast on  
lively hopes of future prosperity, distinc-  
tion and happiness, was doomed to be in-  
terrupted, by an alarming circumstance:  
I had been sent to repair a clock at the  
house of a gentleman in race-street; re-  
turning home, just as I stepped on the  
pavement, I saw a stage coach arrive at a  
neighboring house; wishing to see if any  
of the passengers were known to me, I  
stopped and to my astonishment, saw  
CARNELL descend from it; a cold shud-  
dering seized me; the sight of this be-  
ing filled me with sensations of a dread-  
ful nature; they were connected with a  
sense of the dangers to which I thought  
myself again exposed; this man I was  
convinced, had sought to destroy me,  
and now again haunted me for the same  
dreadful purpose. Yet, how could he  
have discovered my residence? I had  
imparted no hints of the place of my de-  
stination on quitting my native spot, to  
any human being; yet he was here;  
causes with which I was wholly uncon-  
nected, might have induced him to visit  
Philadelphia; pleasure, business for  
aught I knew, this city might be his home,  
yet I still labored under the conviction  
that I, and I alone, was the object of his  
journey, to gratify his revenge, to em-  
brue his hands in the blood of an innocent  
man. And was his vengeance to be gra-  
tified only by my destruction? Was there  
no method of warding off the impending  
danger? Could I not cause him to be ap-  
prehended? I had seen him in my cham-  
ber, armed with the instruments of death,  
at the hour of midnight; but I was the  
only one; my voice alone would not  
condemn him, and if it would, dare I  
charge him with meditating a deed, of  
which he had perhaps never formed an  
idea? It was at least possible, I might  
be mistaken, it might have been some  
other, my apprehensions had probably  
deceived my senses; these and many  
more reflections passed rapidly though  
my mind, but produced no other effect  
than to confuse it with the uncertainty  
of probabilities, and the horrors of appre-  
hension.  
  
Nothing, however could be done; no  
means could be pursued, to ensure my  
safety, or lull my fears. I was obliged  
to wait with patience the unfolding of  
this mystery, and prepare myself to meet,  
with firmness, whatever might happen.  
Walking in the state-house garden[^2]  
was a favorite amusement with EMILIA;  
thither I frequently attended her, when  
the warmth of the summer days, made  
the coolness of the evening, and the frag-  
rance of the garden inviting; here, en-  
joying the society and conversation of  
the object of my fondest affections, -- I  
was suddenly seized by two officers of  
justice: I was surprized[^3], and enquired  
their business, “Our business, Sir,” said  
one of them, “is with you.” You have  
mistaken your object said I, with me you  
have no possible business; they howev-  
er, insisted they were right, they men-  
tioned my name, and even my former  
place of abode; after a vain altercation I  
accompanied them to the mayor’s office,  
and answered many questions, and was  
finally informed I was charged with the  
crime of murder! You may form some  
idea of my astonishment at the informa-  
tion; EMILIA had accompanied me to  
the mayor’s she believed the officers la-  
bored under some mistake, and her feel-  
ings may easily be conceived when she  
found me charged with the commission  
of so detestable a crime; yet what she  
knew of my character and conduct, seem-  
ed not to accord with that of a murder-  
er; she requested I should not be sent  
to prison; she believed me innocent,  
and related those events of my life which  
had fallen under her observation: The  
mayor was a humane man, but he was  
compelled to fulfil the duties of his of-  
fice; “All you have stated,” said he,  
“may be true,” but I, he observed, was  
charged with the murder of a young  
woman, who had long been missing. I  
had entered the city under very sus-  
picious circumstances &c. if I was innocent  
the truth would shortly appear; this was  
not the place of my trial, his duty, how-  
ever, obliged him to confine me, and I  
was sent to prison!  
  
Of all the strange adventures I had  
met with, this was the furthest above my  
comprehension: I could recollect no  
circumstances of my life which could pos-  
sibly create suspicions of this nature:  
I did not think myself a dubious charac-  
ter; during my residence in the city I  
had led a quiet and inoffensive life;  
how then was this to be accounted for?  
It was evident some person had lodged  
information which would justify my con-  
finement, in the judgment of the may-  
or; but here I was almost entirely a  
stranger, and who, except actuated by  
the spirit of a demon, would accuse me  
of any crime, without possessing at least  
a shadow of proof; the crime too, was  
so detestable, I had never even meditate-  
ed it; I was lost and bewildered amidst  
innumerable and useless conjectures: At  
length the idea of CARNELL occurred,  
and with it a train of terrifying images;  
might not he, I asked, have caused my  
apprehension? Might he have not sub-  
orned some desperate villains, to prove  
me guilty of the crime? The conjecture  
seemed probable: instigated by revenge,  
he had already sought my destruction;  
and was not he who could deliberately  
meditate the death of an innocent man,  
capable of any deed, however enormous  
and detestable? Thus did I bewilder my  
senses endeavoring to guess why I  
had been apprehended; my few friends,  
in the mean time, visited me in prison;  
they believed me innocent, and endeav-  
ored to impress a belief, that I would, on  
trial, be proved so, and be honorably ac-  
quitted; for this occasion, I summoned  
all my firmness to my aid, yet I could not  
avoid reflecting with pain on the misfor-  
tunes I had encountered in consequence  
of quitting my paternal home; I had left  
it, chiefly to avoid assassination, and was  
now to suffer death, (perhaps) for a crime  
of the commission of which I was inno-  
cent.

\[ 4. 5 May 1804\]  
  
THE day of trial came; I was con-  
ducted to the bar of the supreme court;  
the eyes of hundreds were upon me; the  
usual question was asked, “*Are you guil-*  
*ty? or not guilty?”* I replied with firm-  
ness “Not guilty!” when the charge was  
read, and I was accused of drowning a  
young woman, by forcibly pushing her  
into the river *Susquehanna!* A smother-  
ed groan was heard from the audience;  
it was not excited by an emotion of pity  
for me, but was a proof of their detesta-  
tion of the author of so shocking a deed;  
I did not blame it, it was honorable to  
their feelings, and evinced the rectitude  
of their hearts. I now found to my sur-  
prise, I was tried for the murder of her  
whose life I would gladly have saved,  
and whose unfortunate end I thought no  
eye, save mine, had witnessed; it now  
appeared, some others had witnessed it  
besides me, but who, and why I was  
charged with the crime, were circum-  
stances, to me, inexplicable. The wit-  
nesses now appeared, but guess, if you  
can, my sensations, when the first I saw,  
was (CARNELL) the same dreadful being  
I had seen in my brother’s chamber, I  
shuddered; my heart beat tremulously  
in my bosom; my sight grew dim, and  
I almost fainted; the spectators seemed  
to consider my emotion a proof of my  
guilt, but they were mistaken. The tri-  
al continued, and new sources of inde-  
scribable astonishment and wonder were  
every moment displayed. The sub-  
stance of the evidence was as follows--  
“That I had planned and effected the  
death of SUSAN WARFIELD; I had been  
heard to say, I would destroy her, by  
any means in my power; that knowing  
she had frequented the scene of her death,  
I had laid in ambush (armed) to effect  
my purpose, and had been seen by the  
evidence (who were fishing at a little  
distance, though in a situation which  
precluded all possibility of rendering as-  
sistance) to push her forcibly into the  
water, where there was little probability  
of her escaping:” All this was new to  
me, so far from planning her death, I had  
scarcely known her, she had consequent-  
ly never given me any cause of offence,  
I was certainly ignorant of the visits of  
any one but myself to the spot I had cho-  
sen for my nocturnal seat; the exertion  
I had made to save her, might, it was  
true, be mistaken for the different one, by  
persons who had seen the transaction  
from a distance; but that it should be  
said, I had declared my intention to de-  
stroy her, and that I had concealed my-  
self to effect this purpose, was really as-  
tonishing: But the witnesses were suf-  
ficient, respectable, positive and uniform  
in their depositions. I had nothing to  
offer in my defence but the truth, but  
who would give credit to the relation of  
one who stood convicted of so foul a  
crime, who had secretly left his native  
home, and entered the city in a manner  
not ill calculated to excite suspicion, had  
concealed his true name and passed un-  
der a different one (CHARLES COLEMAN)  
and betrayed evident marks of guilt and  
confusion, at the sight of his accusers. --  
Had I said, --I had seen CARNELL offer-  
Ing violence to EMILIA; had rescued her  
from his grasp; had seen him in my  
brother’s chamber armed with a dagger,  
at midnight &c. would my tale have  
been credited? No, I had no proofs to  
offer; I had informed no person, not  
even my brother of what I had seen. I  
believed all attempts at defence would  
prove entirely useless, and therefore for-  
bore to make any. I thought it better to  
meet my fate, dreadful and ignominious  
as it was, with manly firmness and un-  
yielding fortitude; my story would be  
treated as the last effort of despairing  
villainy and impotent malice. The  
Judge addressed the jury in a solemn  
and impressive manner; they retired,  
and in a short time, returned with the ex-  
pected virdict[^4], “*guilty!”* They had  
done their duty. I had no cause to com-  
plain, the evidence was sufficient to con-  
demn me; and had I been appointed to  
judge a similar cause I should have act-  
ed in the same manner; I listened to my  
sentence with calmness and composure,  
and was reconducted for the last time,  
to the prison. Thus, I had given you  
a faithful and exact account of my adven-  
tures. -- I shall now shortly suffer an ig-  
nominious death: the world in general  
believe me guilty: but the time may  
come, when what is now hidden from hu-  
man eyes, will be disclosed, -- and then,  
my friend, when the grave shall hide me  
from the world, you, I trust, will do jus-  
tice to my memory.  
  
THUS ended the story of this unfor-  
tunate young man, it was told with the  
greatest apparent sincerity, and my heart  
became deeply interested in his fate. I  
was astonished at the calmness with  
which he supported his misfortunes; he  
was endowed with the keenest sensibili-  
ty, and even timidity of disposition; his  
courage had probably never been awak-  
ened by danger, or perhaps was of that  
kind, which, though unequal to the en-  
counter of sudden and alarming attacks,  
gathered strength by reflection; those  
who best know the various shades of  
character which distinguished mankind,  
know, that there are persons of weak and  
delicate constitutions, who tremble at the  
slightest agitation, while their minds re-  
main firm and undaunted, who, if they  
have time for reflection, meet danger  
with an undaunted front: Thus it ap-  
peared in the present case, here reflection  
seemed to have inspired a contempt of  
death in its most terrified and disgraceful  
form, in the mind of this young man;  
yet there were moments, when his tran-  
quility was disturbed, when the images  
of his father, his friends, and above all,  
his EMILIA presented themselves to  
his imagination: EMILIA loved him with the  
tenderest affection, which even his mis-  
fortunes, (for she believed him guiltless)  
were unable to alienate; yet, for him she  
was doomed to suffer all the evils, flow-  
ing from disappointed love, and the cru-  
el taunts of a misjudging world; these  
causes interrupted his quiet far more  
than his own misfortunes; “my pain,”  
said he will “shortly end; death will  
lull it to rest; but, for them, an ample  
store of anguish is collected, which time  
alone can mitigate.” -- Some pressing af-  
fairs obliging me to hasten to Europe, I  
bade him an eternal *adieu!* The day of his  
execution was at hand, which my depar-  
ture alone spared me the pain of witness-  
ing. --

\[ 5. 12 May 1804\]  
  
SOME years after, I returned to  
Philadelphia; the misfortunes of SAUN-  
DERS, though not forgotten, yet the im-  
pression they made was partly effaced  
by time and various cares.  
While walking one day in front-street,  
I was transported with the sight of SAUN-  
DERS coming towards me: we instantly  
recognized each other, and were folded  
in a mutual embrace; I eagerly interro-  
gated him on that subject, which my for-  
mer knowledge of him and my astonish-  
ment at our present meeting naturally  
excited, when, after entering his house,  
he gave me the following information.  
“The day of my intended execution  
came, and with it my father: His pre-  
sence was more distressing to me, than  
death itself; I wished to spare him the  
pangs a parent must feel, who is doomed  
to witness the ignominious death of a  
son, once dear to his affections: but fate  
had determined otherwise: Some per-  
son had informed him to my expected  
fate, and he hastened to bid me a last  
adieu. He entered my prison, I flew to  
embrace him, he received me with emo-  
tions, which his love of justice had made him  
desirous of suppressing; but the tide of  
nature was powerful, and the severity of  
judge was softened by the tenderness  
of the parent: Think, my friend, what  
must be the feelings of a parent who has  
labored for years to teach his offspring  
the duties of life, and the exercise of vir-  
tue, -- a parent, venerable for his age,  
and whose life, was unstained with a  
crime, when he beholds the object of his  
love, forsake the paths of rectitude, and  
become the most detested villain, and  
your imagination will paint this scene,  
better than my words can describe it:  
He believed me guilty, -- this impression  
I strove to remove, and succeeded:  
falsehood was so mean a crime, that he  
believed me incapable of it, though pas-  
sion might have impelled to the perpetra-  
tion of greater crimes. Yet the convic-  
tion of my innocence did not dispel his  
sorrow; to the pain which the death of a  
son will naturally produce, was added, t  
he shameful manner by which justice in-  
flicted the blow: I should die innocent,  
but would his conviction of this, induce  
the world to believe me so? -- Would not  
my death load my family with shame  
and infamy, which an indiscriminating  
world casts on the relations of a murder  
er? -- But now the appointed hour was  
come -- I bade my friends farewell! and  
the cart moved towards the place of ex-  
ecution; the rope was fastened around  
my neck, the cap was about to be drawn  
over my eyes, and the signal was about  
to be given, the execution of which  
would hide the world from my view for-  
ever, when a sudden and piercing cry of  
“Save him! save him!” was heard and  
a young woman rushed through the  
crowd, to the foot of the gallows; her  
distress and agitation soon discovered  
who she was, it was her for whose mur-  
der I was about to suffer! whom I  
thought I had seen perish on the memo-  
rable night when I left my paternal  
abode! Yet, here she was, by some  
means unaccountable to me, at the foot  
of the gallows, accusing herself as being   
the cause of my misfortunes, and implore-  
ing the sheriff to suspend my execution.  
The crowd pressed tumultuously around,  
and joined their cries to hers. --The  
rope was unfastened, and I reconducted  
to prison.  
  
“I had been saved, in the last moment,  
from an infamous death; a prospect of  
life and liberty was open before me;  
my friends and even the spectators con-  
gratulated me with that tenderness and  
joy which will naturally arise in the bo-  
soms of men, when they behold inno-  
cence snatched from the fate which is  
only the punishment of guilt; yet,  
strange as it may seem, I was the only  
one who seemed to feel but little emo-  
tion: I had long contemplated death as  
certain and inevitable, I had prepared  
myself to meet it with a manly fortitude;  
I wished to prove with what dignity I  
could suffer a fate I had never merited,  
and conscious innocence brightened my  
prospect of eternity; the name of death  
had become familiar and his terrible  
shaft had lost the keenness of its point;  
I returned to prison with but little more  
pleasure than I left it, and some hours  
elapsed ere I was sufficiently sensible of  
the blessing of renewed existence to be  
grateful for the gift; to no one was my  
life more gratifying than the lovely  
EMILIA; her joy was not expressed by  
words, nor displayed by gestures; but  
was painted in lively colors on her ex-  
pressive countenance; a sweet satisfaction  
animated every feature, and gave addi-  
tional lustre to her beaming eyes.  
“You will naturally be anxious to  
know how this change was produced;  
WARFIELD’S information was as fol-  
lows; she had, for some reason she did  
not explain, determined to anticipate the  
hand of death by drowning herself; that  
she attempted it, you know; but the fear  
of death, proved stronger than her dis-  
gust of life, and with great difficulty she  
saved herself from that fate she had  
sought with so much secresy; but,  
dreading to return home and endure the  
severity of her parents’ reproaches (who  
she supposed would be made acquainted  
with the circumstance) she fled to a rela-  
tion in Maryland: Meanwhile the intel-  
ligence of my fate reached her; alarmed  
at the consequences her folly was likely  
to occasion, she hastened to Philadel-  
phia, thinking it probable she might ar-  
rive in time to avert the fate which hung  
over me; when she reached the city,  
she saw the immense concourse of peo-  
ple, who had assembled to witness my  
execution; curiosity led her to enquire  
my crime; the moment was propitious,  
and my life was preserved. Yet reflec-  
tion dissipated a greater part of my joy,  
when I considered my situation,  
my innocence of the crime of murder  
was proved and I should probably be  
liberated in a short time from confine-  
ment; but who was to prove me inno-  
cent of meditated guilt? Would not I  
still be treated as a being dangerous to  
the community? Would the world consi-  
der me as much less guilty than before?  
I should be detested by all mankind, and  
condemned to wander through the world  
like an outcast from human society; I  
was conscious of my innocence, it is  
true; this had supported me at the most  
trying moment of my existence; but  
that proud, unbending spirit I had receiv-  
ed from nature, and which had been  
strengthened by education, recoiled at  
the prospect. I wished to deserve the  
good opinion of all mankind, to command  
respect, though I could not inspire love;  
how then should I be able, when walking  
through the streets of the city, to bear to  
be shunned by all good men, and treated  
as a being with whom no one could safe-  
ly commune; these reflections gave me  
intolerable anguish; I was almost tempt-  
ed to wish I had perished at the hand of  
justice; I should then have slept quietly  
with the dead, the grave would have  
shielded me from the scorn of mankind,  
and insured my tranquility.  
  
“By my uneasiness was happily re-  
lieved--on the day succeeding that on  
which my life was saved, I was saved  
from a fate which I considered as little  
better than death, in the following man-  
ner, several of the persons who were wit-  
nesses at my trial visited me in prison,  
one of whom gave me the following wel-  
come information, which I will give you  
in his own words.

\[ 6. 19 May 1804\]  
  
“THAT the motives of my con-  
duct, and that of my colleagues may be  
understood, and our innocence of any de-  
sign against your life, or the crime of  
perjury may be proved; I shall relate a  
few circumstances which happened pre-  
vious to your unfortunate journey to Phi-  
ladelphia: Being on a visit of some  
length in the neighborhood of your late  
residence, we happened to stop one even-  
ing at an inn, where we heard a young  
man (who we then thought was you)  
express his intention of effecting the  
death of SUSAN WARFIELD; he said her  
base treatment of him, would justify any  
measures, however violent and sanguina-  
ry; it was such, as no human being,  
however gentle, would suffer to pass,  
without the severest punishment; and fi-  
nally, he said he would effect her destruct-  
tion in any manner whatever; we saw  
him, though we were in the next room,  
through the glazed door; he, I believe,  
was unconscious of our presence: he de-  
clared his intention to his companion,  
while intoxicated with passion and foam-  
ing with rage and fury; the circumstance  
made some impression on our minds;  
but we believed his words proceeded  
from the violence of his passion, and did  
not doubt, but during the paroxysms of  
anger, he had meditated, what when rea-  
son again regulated his conduct, he  
would certainly not execute; for these  
reasons we were silent, until some  
months after; we were accustomed du-  
ring the moon-light summer nights to  
fish for eels in a small stream which  
emptied into the river Susquehanna, the  
situation we usually chose commanded a  
near view of the rocky eminence where  
we could observe all that passed without  
being seen; here we saw you frequent-  
ly arrive, armed with a club in the night;  
near this place WARFIELD usually pass-  
ed the evening with her lover, as his vi-  
sits to her father’s house were forbidden;  
these circumstance, compared with what  
we had witnessed at the inn, excited our  
suspicions, and you were narrowly watch-  
ed; -- one night, while pursuing our usu-  
al sport, we saw WARFIELD approach  
you; we saw you rise soon after, rush  
upon, and push her into the river; all  
this was done in a few minutes, nor was  
it in our power, (though in a short  
distance) to prevent, or to save WAR  
FIELD; as to reach you, we should have  
been obliged to take a circuitous rout:  
we therefore watched you, as you had to  
pass very near where we were concealed,  
by the trees, (it should be recollected,  
that we still believed, you was the same  
person we had seen at the inn.) That  
night you absconded, and it was long  
ere our inquiries traced you to Philadel-  
phia. We caused your apprehension  
and conviction. --As we were returning  
home to Maryland (our place of resi-  
dence) we lodged at an inn on the road,  
where, on entering, to our astonishment  
we saw a man sitting in the room, so  
much resembling you, that we were ful-  
ly persuaded you had escaped from pri-  
son; without a moment’s hesitation we  
seized him; his astonishment seemed  
equal to our own; he said he was in  
search of his wife, who had left his house  
in Maryland, and he believed had gone  
to her father’s on the banks of the Sus-  
quehanna; he told his story with appa-  
rent sincerity, and with that confidence  
which innocence, or impudence, only,  
can assume when charged with a crime;  
we gazed on each other in silent wonder;  
with the banks of the Susquehanna we  
were somewhat acquainted; we asked  
him many questions which he readily an-  
swered; but when we charged him with  
the crime for which you were condemn-  
ed to suffer, he replied, if possible, with  
increasing astonishment; SUSAN WAR-  
FIELD is my wife! Not many days have  
elapsed since I saw her; he explain-  
ed to us several circumstances, all which  
filled us with horror and consternation;  
in short, we were made acquainted with  
every circumstance necessary to prove  
your innocence: Judge then, if you can,  
what we felt; we had caused the death  
of a guiltless and deserving man, he had  
been deceived by an unusual resemblance  
between two persons. unknown to each  
other: the day appointed for the exe-  
cution had already passed and you had  
probably been punished for a deed you  
had never committed; but the pangs of  
death, and the extremest tortures were  
bliss compared to the horrible sensations  
we experienced. –Yet there was still a  
possibility of your execution being defer-  
red; this had more than once, been the  
case; the life of a man and our own fu-  
ture peace were at stake, and while there  
was the most distant hope it might be  
saved, it was our duty and our wish to  
make the experiment. To return to Phila-  
delphia and to take CARSON with us,  
was a resolution adopted and instantly  
put into execution; to our inexpressible  
joy our journey has not been vain; you  
will scarcely be able, sufferer as you have  
been, to forgive us, who have been,  
though unintentionally, the cause of your  
misfortunes; but could you know the  
torments we have felt, when in imagina-  
tion, we saw your injured spirit rise from  
the shades of death, and accuse us of des-  
troying you by deeds perpetrated only by  
the most abandoned of mankind, and  
when you have seen the dreadful resem-  
blance which caused our unfortunate er-  
ror; you will look on us with less detest-  
ation than is at present possible.” –  
He ceased, went out, and soon return-  
ed with CARSON––here was indeed an  
extraordinary resemblance, so exact, so  
striking, that all present were filled with  
astonishment: but for a small difference in  
our height, the most intimate friend  
could have scarcely distinguished us  
from each other; from these men I learn-  
ed that the dreadful CARNELL was dead,  
and thus another cause of uneasiness was  
removed. I was now soon liberated, re-  
stored to that respect I had before enjoy-  
ed, and united to that amiable woman,  
EMILIA, who had been one of the first  
causes of my misfortunes. In her I have  
found a woman of a superior understand-  
ing, enlightened mind, gentle dispo-  
sition, her superior judgment has correct-  
ed many of my errors; she has lessen-  
ed that love of distinction and celebrity,  
which I had once indulged, and which I  
had attained by means, as unwelcome,  
as unexpected; she has convinced me,  
that fame is not always the portion of  
merit, that to deserve the esteem of man-  
kind, was a superior enjoyment to an en-  
larged mind, than distinction or fame  
could bestow. “
