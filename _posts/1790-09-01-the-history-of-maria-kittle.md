### Preface  

The *New York Magazine, or Literary Repository* (1790-1797) was one of the longest running American magazines of the 1700s and is commonly studied because of its status as a particularly influential periodical of the early republic. It was in print for 8 years and had almost 100 issues. It published accounts of theater performances and travel as well as current events and extracts of essays and creative works. The publishers were Thomas and James Swords of New York, who published two other Christian journals around the same time and printed bound books as well. The *New York Magazine*’s overall contents are eclectic and seem to claim a curatorship of the interests of the intellectual elite, including George Washington and John Adams. However, the subscription list reveals a varied readership, about half of whom were artisans and shopkeepers.

*The History of Maria Kittle* was first serialized in the *New York Magazine* from September 1790 to January 1791, with each update appearing monthly for a total of five installments. The magazine also published some of Bleecker’s other work, especially poetry; however, each piece was submitted by Bleecker’s daughter Margaretta V. Faugeres several years after her mother’s death. T. and J. Swords, went on to publish the *Posthumous Works of Ann Eliza Bleecker, in Prose and Verse* in bound form in 1793, which included *The History of Maria Kittle,* another unfinished historical novel called *The History of Henry and Ann*, a collection of poetry and letters, and some of Margaretta’s own literary work. Because of its immense popularity, *The History of Maria Kittle* was finally republished separately in its own volume in 1797 by Elisha Babcock of Hartford, Connecticut. There is very little difference between the text published in the magazine and stand-alone novel versions of the tale, beyond minor editorial revisions. Interestingly, a nineteenth-century New York women’s magazine called *The Ladies’ Literary Cabinet, Being a Repository of Miscellaneous Literary Productions, both Original and Selected in Prose and Verse* (1819-1822) republished the novel in serial form beginning in 1821. It was common practice to republish work this way, and *The History of Maria Kittle* may have appeared in other periodicals as well.

*The History of Maria Kittle* is often described as the first captivity novel because it utilizes the captivity narrative form without a solid basis on actual experience. This is ironic given the opening lines of the novel. Thereare claims that the novel is based on the actual experiences of Maria Kittle or Kittlehyun, whose family lived in the same region as the Bleeckers, and whose captivity narrative can be corroborated by an account with similar detail in another memoir. However, the text of the novel emphasizes several other themes independent of historical fidelity, leaving room for a more creative retelling. One of its major themes, conflict between native and colonial Americans, had major impact on the way other writers dealt with the issue. For example, Bleecker may have influenced Cooper’s approach to Native Americans in *The Last of the Mohicans*.

Bleecker’s novel adopts many of the literary tropes of her time, including the captivity narrative, epistolary structure, reliance on the power of sentiment, religious didacticism, elegiac verse, and the domestic manifestation of national politics. The plot reflects Maria Kittle’s capture by Native Americans at the time of the French and Indian War, the loss of most her family including her two young children to the violence of her abductors, their flight to Montreal where she is revived by a circle of sympathetic English and French women, and her eventual miraculous reunion with her husband. The treatment of the Native American characters is very stereotypical. She depicts them as untrustworthy, brutal savages who murder women and children. However, the combination of Maria Kittle’s account and Bleecker’s own life experience during the Revolutionary War leads to an overall meditation on loss in the novel, especially feminine, maternal loss, and the comfort of female fellowship. The displacement of the conflict Bleecker herself experienced onto Maria Kittle’s situation among her Indian neighbors leads to the foregrounding of women’s issues in the politics of early America and white women’s role in nation building. Her story examines the emotional trauma of collateral damage, especially as a woman effected by the conflicts of early America.

Though few scholars have analyzed Bleecker’s work at length, and those who have focus mainly on her pastoral poetry or the historical significance of her work and its politics, especially her treatment of Native Americans, very few if any critics have discussed the significance of the novel’s original and continued serialization. This leaves several intriguing questions unanswered. For example: What made this tale such a good fit for this magazine and its readership? Also, further research should be done on the way each installment can be read in isolation from the others, in context of the other work published in the magazine, and in relation to the layers of time it represents from its authorship in 1779 to its depiction of pre-revolution events and relevance to the conditions of the time of publication and republication. The novel is depicted here as it appeared in the *New York Magazine*, its first publication, in order to foster further answers to these questions.

__Biography of Ann Bleeker__

Ann Bleeker was born Anna Elizabeth Schuyler around October 1752 as the sixth child of Margareta Van Wyck and BrandtSchuyler, prosperous Dutch merchants and aristocrats of New York City.Her father Brandt Schuyler died shortly before she was born, and her mother married Anthony Ten Eyck in 1760. Their daughter Susanna is the addressee of Ann’s epistolary captivity novel *The History of Maria Kittle.* Ann married into another prominent Dutch family in 1769, becoming the wife of lawyer John James Bleecker, who encouraged her writing. They moved to Tomhanick, a more agricultural region near Albany, in 1771, which inspired much of Ann’s pastoral poetry. The Bleeckers had two daughters. The eldest, Margaretta, also became a writer and was responsible for publishing most of her mother’s work. The younger daughter Abella died of dysentery in 1777 during the Revolutionary War when the family was forced to flee their home in Tomhanick because the British General Burgoyne’s troops were invading the area from the North. Ann saw her mother die during the flight southward, and then her sister Caty Swits died on the return journey. Ann, her daughter Margaretta, and a mullato girl survived. John Bleecker was absent for the entire episode, fighting for the militia in support of the revolution.

At home again in 1779, Ann produced a periodical called the *Albany Gazette* filled with her own essays and poetry for her family and friends to read. This highlights the significance of the periodical genre to early Americans and to Bleecker specifically. However, much of her writing after so much personal loss, including the novel transcribed here, dealt with grief. Unfortunately, Ann’s husband, who continued in the militia, was captured in 1781, and Ann suffered a miscarriage and mental breakdown in shock. Her husband was rescued quickly, but she never completely regained her spirits and died November 23, 1783.

In *The History of Maria Kittle*, Bleecker deals specifically with mothers mourning the loss of their children and other family members in times of violence. However, by using the structure of a captivity narrative and the setting of the French and Indian War, the novel explores this theme while vilifying Native Americans rather than the British. This trend of scapegoating and demonizing Native Americans continued into the nineteenth century. Although, Bleecker herself did not live to see much peace in the newly formed United States, her words survived to comfort, entertain and challenge other citizens of the new nation. Though her novel and other work enjoyed enormous popularity in the early republic, it went out of fashion until more recent scholars went looking for alternative perspectives of American history and early examples of the American novel.

HISTORY OF MARIA KITTLE  
  
Dear Susan,  
  
HOWEVER fond of novels and  
romances you may be, the un-  
fortunate adventures of one of my  
neighbours, who died yesterday, will  
make you despise that fiction, in  
which, knowing the subject to be fa-  
bulous, we can never be so truly in-  
terested. While this lady was expir-  
ing, Mrs. C-- V--, her near  
kinswoman, related to me her unhap-  
py history, in which I shall now take  
the liberty of interesting your bene-  
volent and feeling heart.--  
Maria Kittle was the only issue of  
her parents, who cultivated a large  
farm on the banks of Hudson, eigh-  
teen miles above Albany. They were  
persons of good natural abilities, im-  
proved by some learning; yet, con-  
scious of a deficiency in their educa-  
tion, they studied nothing so much  
as to render their little daughter truly  
accomplished.  
  
Maria was born in the year 1721.  
Her promising infancy presaged a ma-  
turity of excellencies; every amiable  
quality dawned through her lisping  
prattle; every personal grace attend-  
ed her attitudes and played over her  
features. As she advanced through  
the playful stage of childhood, she  
became more eminent than a Pene-  
lope for her industry; yet, soon as the  
sun declined, she always retired with  
her books until the time of repose,  
by which means she soon informed  
her opening mind with the princi-  
ples of every useful science. She was  
beloved by all her female companions,  
who, though they easily discovered  
her superior elegance of manners,  
instead of envying, were excited to  
imitate her. As she always made one  
in their little parties of pleasure on  
festival days, it is no wonder that she  
soon became the reigning goddess  
among the swains. She was impor-  
tuned to admit the addresses of num-  
bers, whom she politely discarded,  
and withdrew herself a while from  
public observation. However, the  
fame of her charms attracted several  
gentlemen of family from Albany,  
who intruded on her retirement, so-  
liciting her hand. But this happi-  
ness was reserved for a near relation  
of her's, one Mr. Kittle, whose me-  
rits had made an impression on her  
heart. He, although not handsome,  
was possessed of a most engaging ad-  
dress, while his learning and moral  
virtues more particularly recommend-  
ed him to her esteem. Their parents  
soon discovered their reciprocal pas-  
sion, and highly approving of it, has-  
tened their marriage, which was ce-  
lebrated under the most happy au-  
spices.  
  
Maria was fifteen when married.  
They removed to his farm, on which  
he had built a small neat house, sur-  
rounded by tall cedars, which gave it  
a contemplative air. It was situated  
on an eminence, with a green enclo-  
sure in the front; graced by a well-  
cultivated garden on one side, and on  
the other by a clear stream, which,  
rushing over a bed of white pebble,  
gave them a high polish, that cast a  
soft gleam through the water.  
Here they resided in the tranquil  
enjoyment of that happiness which so  
much merit and innocence deserved;  
the indigent, the sorrowful, the un-  
fortunate, were always sure of con-  
solation when they entered those  
peaceful doors. They were almost  
adored by their neighbours, and even  
the wild savages themselves, who of-  
ten resorted thither for refreshments,  
when hunting, expressed the greatest  
regard for them, and admiration of  
their virtues.  
  
In little more than a year they  
were blessed with a daughter, the  
lovelier resemblance of her lovely  
mother; as she grew up her graces in­  
creasing, promised a bloom and un-  
derstanding equal to her's; the Indi-  
ans, in particular, were extremely  
fond of the smiling Anna; whenever  
they found a young fawn, or caught  
a brood of wood-ducks, or surprised  
the young beaver in their daily ex-  
cursions through the forests, they pre-  
sented them with pleasure to her;  
they brought her the earliest straw-  
berries, the scarlet plumb, and other  
delicate wild fruits, in painted bas-  
kets.  
  
How did the fond parents' hearts  
delight to see their beloved one so  
universally caressed? When they  
sauntered over the vernal fields with  
the little prattler wantoning before  
them collecting flowers, and pursu-  
ing the velvet elusive butterfly, Ma-  
ria’s cheek suffusing with rapture,  
"oh, my dear!" she would say, "we  
are happier than human beings can  
expect to be; how trivial are the evils  
annexed to our situation? may God  
avert that our Heaven be limited to  
this life!"  
  
Eleven years now elapsed before  
Mrs. Kittle discovered any signs of  
pregnancy; her spouse silently wish-  
ed for a son, and his desires were at  
length gratified; she was delivered of  
a charming boy, who was named,  
after him, William.  
  
A French and Indian war had  
commenced sometime before, but  
about eight months after her delivery,  
the savages began to commit the most  
horrid depredations on the English  
frontiers. Mr. Kittle, alarmed at  
the danger of his brother, who dwelt  
near Fort-Edward, (the eldest being  
just married to a very agreeable young  
woman) invited them to reside with  
him during the war.  
  
They were scarce arrived when the  
enemy made farther incursions in the  
country, burning the villages, and  
scalping the inhabitants, neither re-  
specting age or sex. This terribly  
alarmed Mrs. Kittle; she began to  
prepare for flight, and the next even-  
ing after receiving this intelligence,  
as she and Mr. Kittle were busily em-  
ployed in packing up china and other  
things, they were accosted by several  
Indians, whose wigwams were con-  
tiguous to the village of Schochti-  
cook, and who always seemed well  
affected to the English. An elderly  
savage undertook to be prolocutor, and  
desired the family to compose them-  
selves, assuring them they should be  
cautioned against any approaching  
danger. To inforce his argument,  
he presented Maria with a belt inter-  
woven with silk and beads, saying,  
"there, receive my token of friend-  
ship.--we go to dig up the hatchet,  
to sink it in the heads of your ene-  
mies: we shall guard this wood with  
a wall of fire--you shall be safe." A  
warm glow of hope deepened in Ma-  
ria’s cheek at this. Then ordering  
wine to be brought to the friendly  
savages, with a smile of diffidence,  
"I am afraid," said she, "necessity  
may oblige you to abandon us, or  
neglect of your promise may deprive  
us of your protection."--"Neglect  
of my promise," retorted he with  
some acrimony, "no, Maria, I am  
a true man; I shoot the arrow up to  
the Great Captain every new moon:  
depend upon it I will trample down  
the briers round your dwelling, that  
you do not hurt your feet." Maria  
now retired, bowing a grateful ac-  
knowledgment, and leaving the sa-  
vages to indulge their festivity, who  
passed the night in the most vocife-  
rous mirth.  
  
Mrs. Kittle with a sort of exulta-  
tion, related the subject of their con-  
ference to her husband, who had ab-  
sented himself on their first appear-  
ance, having formed some suspicion  
of the sincerity of their friendship,  
and not being willing to be duped by  
their dissimulation. "And now,"  
added Maria, smiling, "our fears  
may again subside: oh! my dear,  
my happiness is trebled into rapture,  
by seeing you and my sweet babes  
out of danger." He only sighed,  
and reaching his arm round her po-  
lished neck, pressed her to his bosom.  
After a short pause, "my love," said  
he, "be not too confident of their  
fidelity, you surely know what a small  
dependence is to be placed in their  
promises; however, to appear suspi-  
cious, might be suddenly fatal to us,  
we will therefore suspend our jour-  
ney to Albany for a few days."--  
Though Maria's soul saddened at the  
conviction of this truth; though her  
fears again urged her to propose im-  
mediate flight, yet she acquiesced;  
and having supped with the family,  
this tender pair sunk asleep on the  
bosom of rest.  
  
Early the next morning Mr. Kittle  
arose; first impressing a kiss on Maria's  
soft cheek, as she slumbered with her  
infant in her arms. He then awak-  
ed his brother, reminding him that  
he had proposed a hunting match the  
preceding evening. "It is true,"  
replied Peter, "but since hostilities  
have commenced so near us as the  
Indians inform, I think it rather im-  
prudent to quit the family."--  
"Come, come," replied the other,  
"do not let us intimidate the neigh­  
bours by cloistering ourselves up with  
women and children."--"I reject  
the thought," rejoined Peter, "of  
being afraid." Then having dressed  
himself, while his brother charged  
their pieces, they left the house, and  
traversed the pathless grass for many  
hours without perceiving any thing  
but small birds, who filled the fra-  
grant air with melody. "Peter,"  
said Mr. Kittle, casting his eyes a-  
round the lovely landscape, "what  
a profusion of sweets does nature ex-  
hale to please her intelligent creatures.  
I feel my heart expand with love and  
gratitude to Heaven every moment,  
nor can I ever be grateful enough. I  
have health and competence, a lovely  
fond wife, whose smile would calm  
the rudest storm of passion, and two  
infants blossoming into perfection;  
all my social ties are yet unbroken--  
Peter, I anticipate my Heaven--!  
But why, my brother, do you turn  
pale? what dreadful idea stiffens  
your features with amazement? what  
in God's name ails you, Peter, are  
you unwell? sit down under this tree  
awhile."--To these interrogatories  
Peter replied, "excuse my weakness,  
I am not unwell, but an unusual  
horror chilled my blood; I felt as if  
the damps of death prest already  
round my soul; but the vapour is  
gone off again, I feel quite better."  
Mr. Kittle cheered his brother, attri-  
buting his emotion to fear, who, by  
this time, having reassumed his com-  
posure, entered into discourse with  
cheerfulness, refusing to return home  
without having killed any thing.  
Then rising, they proceeded thro’  
lofty groves of pine, and open fields,  
that seemed to bend under the heavy  
hand of Ceres. At last, disappoint-  
ment and fatigue prevailed on them  
to return home; they had gone far-  
ther than they apprehended; but  
passing along the bank of the river,  
within a few miles of Mr. Kittle's,  
they espied a fat doe walking secure-  
ly on the beach, which Peter softly  
approaching, levelled his piece with  
so good an aim, that the animal drop-  
ped. Instantly at the explosion, this  
seeming success was, however, the  
origin of their calamities; for imme-  
diately after two savages appeared,  
directed in their course by the firing.  
Setting up a loud yell, they ran up  
to the brothers and discharged their  
fire arms. Mr. Kittle started back,  
but Peter received a brace of balls in  
his bosom. He recoiled a few steps  
back, and then sunk down income-  
passed by those deadly horrors of  
which in the morning he had a pre-  
sentiment. Mr. Kittle stood awhile  
aghast, like a person just waked from  
a frightful dream; but on seeing the  
Indian advancing to tear the scalp  
from his dying brother, he suddenly  
recollected himself, and shot a bullet  
through his head. Then grappling  
with the other, who was loading  
again, he wrestled his firelock from  
him, and felled him to the ground  
with the butt end of it. This was  
no time for reflection, or unavailing  
laments; the danger was eminent!  
So leaving the savages for dead, with  
a mournful silence Mr. Kittle hasten-  
ed to throw the deer from off his  
horse, and laid his bleeding brother  
across him.  
  
When our souls are gloomy, they  
seem to cast a shade over the objects  
that surround us, and make nature  
correspondent to our feelings: so Mr.  
Kittle thought the night fell with a  
deeper gloom than usual. The soft  
notes of evening birds seemed to be  
the responses of savage yells. The  
echo of his tread, which he never  
before regarded, now rung dismally  
hollow in his ears. Even the rust-  
ling of the winds through the leaves  
seemed attended with a solemnity  
that chilled him with cold tremors.  
As he proceeded with his mournful  
charge, his feelings were alarmed for  
his dear Maria; he dreaded the agi-  
tation and distress this adventure  
would throw her in--but it was un-  
avoidable!  
  
The sound of his horse's feet no  
sooner invaded the ears of Maria,  
than seizing a light, she sprung with  
a joyful impatience to the door, and  
was met by her partner pale and  
bloody, who endeavoured to prevent  
too sudden a discovery of this cala-  
mity. But at the first glance she  
comprehended the whole affair, and  
retiring a few steps, with the most  
exquisite agony in her countenance,  
"oh! Mr. Kittle," she cried, clasping  
her hands together, "it is all over--  
we are betrayed--your brother is kil-  
led!"--"Too true, oh! too fatally  
true," replied he, falling on his knees  
beside her as she sunk down,” "my  
angel! the very savages that solemnly  
engaged to protect us have deprived  
him of life; but I am yet alive, my  
Maria, be comforted--I will instant-  
ly procure carriages, and before morn-  
ing you and your innocents shall be  
beyond the reach of their malevo-  
lence."  
  
By this time the family had croud-  
ed about them, and with grievous  
wailings were enquiring the particu-  
lars of this sad adventure. Mr. Kit-  
tle having related every circumstance  
with brevity, ordered the corpse to  
be laid in a remote chamber, desiring  
at the same time a horse to be saddled  
for him. Then, more oppressed by  
his wife's griefs than his own, he led  
the disconsolate fair to her chamber,  
where, being seated, she sighing de-  
manded where he intended to go at  
that time of night. "Only," said  
he, "to the village of Schochticook  
to hire a couple of waggons; I shall  
return in an hour I hope, with a pro-  
per guard to secure our retreat from  
this hostile place." Maria was silent;  
at length she burst into a flood of tears,  
which his endearments only aug-  
mented. Then expostulating with  
him, "is it not enough," cried she,  
"that you have escaped one danger,  
but must you be so very eager to en-  
counter others? besides, you are spent  
with sorrow and fatigue--let one of  
your brothers perform this silent ex-  
pedition.--"It is impossible," re-  
plied the tender husband; "how can  
I dare to propose a danger to them  
from which I would shrink myself?  
their lives are equally precious with  
mine--but God may disappoint our  
fears, my love." He would have  
continued, but his spouse, rising from  
her seat, interrupted him--"At least,  
my dear, before you leave us give  
your lovely babes a farewell embrace,  
that if fate should--should--separate  
us, that yet shall sweeten our hours  
of absence." Here she found her-  
self clasped in her consort's arms, who  
exclaimed, "my Maria! I love you  
passionately, and if the least shadow  
of danger did appear to attend this  
night's travel, for your sake, for my  
blessed children's sake I would decline  
it--but I have left the Indians life-  
less, who, no doubt, attacked us from  
some private pique--nor will they  
be discovered until morning."--  
"Well then," Maria answered, "I  
no longer oppose you; forgive my  
fears." Mean while as she stept  
to the cradle for her suckling, the fair  
Anna, who was listening at the door,  
anxious to hear her parents’ senti-  
ments on this occasion, quitted her  
station, and flew to them swift as  
light, dropping on her knees before  
her father, and looked up in his face  
with the most attractive graces, and  
the persuasive eloquence of simplicity.  
Her neck and features were elegantly  
turned, her complexion fairer than  
the tuberose, and contrasted by the  
most shining ringlets of dark hair.  
Her eyes, whose brilliancy were sof-  
tened through the medium of tears,  
for a while dwelt tenderly on his  
countenance. At length, with a  
voice scarce audible, she sighed out,  
"oh, Papa! do not leave us; if any  
accident should happen to you,  
Mamma will die of grief, and what  
will become of poor Anna and Billy?  
who will care for me? Who will teach  
me when my Papa, my Mamma's  
Papa is gone?"--"My sweet child,"  
replied he, embracing her and hold-  
ing her to his bosom, "there is no  
danger; I shall return in an hour,  
and before to-morrow you shall be  
safe on the plains of Albany, and my  
heart shall exult over the happiness of  
my family.”  
  
Mrs. Kittle now approached with  
her playful infant in her arms; but its  
winning actions extorted nothing but  
groans from her pained bosom, which  
was more stormy than Ontario Lake,  
when agitated by fierce winds. Mr.  
Kittle perceiving this uncommon e-  
motion, gently took the child from  
her, and repeatedly kissed it, while  
new smiles dimpled its lovely aspect.  
"Oh!" said he to himself, "this  
gloom that darkens Maria's soul is  
supernatural!--it seems dreadfully  
portentious!--Shall I yet stay?" But  
here a servant informing him that his  
horse was ready, he blushed at his  
want of fortitude; and having con-  
quered his irresolution, after the most  
affecting and solemn parting, he quit-  
ted his house, never to review it  
more!

Maria then walked sadly back  
again, and having assembled  
the family in a little hall, they closed  
and barred the doors. Mrs. Cornelia  
Kittle, Maria's sister-in-law, was far  
advanced in her pregnancy, which  
increased her husband's uneasiness for  
her; and they were debating in what  
manner to accommodate her at Al-  
bany, when the trampling of feet  
about the house, and a yell of com-  
plicated voices, announced the Indi-  
ans’ arrival. Struck with horror and  
consternation, the little family croud-  
ed together in the center of the hall,  
while the servants, at this alarm, be-  
ing in a kitchen distant from the  
house, saved themselves by a precipi-  
tate flight. The little Billy, frighten-  
ed at such dreadful sounds, clung fast  
to his mother's throbbing breast, while  
Anna, in a silent agony of amaze-  
ment, clasped her trembling knees.  
The echo of their yells yet rung in  
long vibrations through the forest,  
when, with a thundering peal of  
strokes at the door, they demanded  
entrance. Distraction and despair  
sat upon every face. Maria and her  
companions gazed wildly at each o-  
ther, till upon repeated menaces, and  
efforts to break open the door, Co-  
rnelia's husband giving all for lost, lei-  
surely advanced to the door. Corne-  
lia seeing this, uttered a great shriek,  
and cried out, "oh God! what are  
you doing, my rash, rash, unfortu-  
nate husband? you will be sacrificed."  
Then falling on her knees, she caught  
hold of his hand, and sobbed out,  
"oh! pity me, have mercy on your-  
self, on me, on my child!"--"Alas!  
my love," said he, half turning, with  
a look of distraction, "what can we  
do? let us be resigned to the will of  
God!" So saying, he unbarred the  
door, and that instant received a fatal  
bullet in his bosom, and fell back-  
ward writhing in the agonies of death;  
the rest recoiled at this horrible spec-  
tacle, and huddled in a corner, send-  
ing forth the most piercing cries; in  
the interim the savages rushing in  
with great shouts, proceeded to man-  
gle the corpse, and having made an  
incision round his head with a crook-  
ed knife, they tugged off his bloody  
scalp with barbarous triumph. While  
this was perpetrating, an Indian, he-  
deously painted, strode ferociously up  
to Cornelia, (who sunk away at the  
sight, and fainted on a chair) and clift  
her white forehead deeply with his  
tomahack. Her fine azure eyes just  
opened, and then suddenly closing  
forever, she tumbled lifeless at his  
feet. His sanguinary soul was not  
yet satisfied with blood; he deform-  
ed her lovely body with deep gashes,  
and tearing her unborn babe away,  
dashed it to pieces against the stone  
wall, with many additional circum-  
stances of infernal cruelty.  
  
During this horrid carnage, the  
dead were stripped, and dragged from  
the house, when one of the hellish  
band advanced to Maria, who cir-  
cling her babes with her white arms,  
was sending hopeless petitions to Hea-  
ven, and bemoaning their cruelly  
lost situation--as he approached, ex-  
pecting the fatal stroke, she endea-  
voured to guard her children, and  
with supplicating looks, implored for  
mercy. The savage attempted not to  
strike; but the astonishing Anna shel-  
tered herself behind her Mamma,  
while her blooming suckling quitting  
her breast, gazed with a pleasing  
wonder on the painted stranger.--  
Maria soon recognized her old friend  
that presented her with the belt, thro’  
the loads of shells and feathers that  
disguised him. This was no time,  
however, to irritate him, by remind-  
ing him of his promise; yet, guess-  
ing her thoughts, he anticipated her  
remonstrance. "Maria," said he,  
"be not afraid, I have promised to  
protect you--you shall live and dance  
with us around the fire at Canada;  
but you have one small incumbrance,  
which, if not removed, will much  
impede your progress thither;" so say-  
ing he seized her laughing babe by  
the wrists, and forcibly endeavoured  
to draw him from her arms. At this,  
terrified beyond conception, she ex-  
claimed, "oh God! leave me--leave  
me my child! he shall not go, though  
a legion of devils should try to se-  
parate us!" holding him still fast,  
while the Indian applied his strength  
to tear him away, gnashing his teeth  
at her opposition, "help! God of  
Heaven!" screamed she, "help!  
have pity--have mercy on this infant!  
Oh God! oh Christ! can you bear  
to see this? O mercy! mercy!  
mercy! let a little spark of compass-  
sion save this inoffending--this love-  
ly angel!” By this time the breath-  
less babe dropt its head on its bosom;  
the wrists were nigh pinched off, and  
seeing him just expiring, with a  
dreadful shriek she resigned him to  
the merciless hands of the savage,  
who instantly dashed his little fore-  
head against the stones, and casting  
his bleeding body at some distance  
from the house, left him to make his  
exit in feeble and unheard groans.--  
Then indeed, in the unutterable an-  
guish of her soul, she fell prostrate,  
and rending away her hair, she roar-  
ed out her sorrows with a voice louder  
than natural, and rendered awfully  
hollow by too great an exertion.  
"Oh, barbarians!" she exclaimed,  
"surpassing devils in wickedness, so  
may a tenfold night of misery enwrap  
your black souls, as you have depri-  
ved the babe of my bosom, the com-  
fort of my cares--my blessed cherub  
of light and life--Oh hell! are not  
thy flames impatient to cleave the  
center and engulph these wretches in  
thy ever burning waves? are there no  
thunders in Heaven--no avenging  
Angel--no God, to take notice of  
such Heaven-defying cruelties?"--  
Then rushing to her dead infant with  
redoubled cries, and clapping her  
hands, she laid herself over his man-  
gled body--again softened in tears  
and moans, she wiped the blood from  
his ghastly countenance, and prest  
him to her heaving bosom, alternately  
caressing him and her trembling An-  
na, who, clinging to her with bitter  
wailings, and kissing her hands and  
face, entreated her to implore the sa-  
vages for mercy. "Do, my angel  
Mamma," she urged, "do beg them  
yet to pity­-beg them yet to save you  
for my poor, poor Papa's sake!--  
Alas! if we are all killed, his heart  
will break!--Oh! they can't be rocks  
and stones!--Don't cry Mamma,  
they will spare us!” Thus the little  
orator endeavoured to console her af-  
flicted mother; but their melancho-  
ly endearments were soon interrupted  
by the relentless savages, who having  
plundered the house of every valua-  
ble thing that was portable, returned  
to Maria, and rudely catching her  
arm, commanded her to follow them;  
but repulsing them with the boldness  
of despair, "leave me, leave me,"  
she said, "I cannot go--I never will  
quit my murdered child! too cruel  
in your mercies, you have given me  
life only to prolong my miseries!"--  
Mean while the lovely Anna, terri-  
fied at the hostile appearance of the  
enemy, left her Mamma (struggling  
to disengage herself from the Indians)  
and fled precipitately to the house.  
She had already concealed herself in  
a closet, when Mrs. Kittle pursuing  
her, was intercepted by flames, the  
savages having fired the house. The  
wretched child soon discovered her  
deplorable situation, and almost suf-  
focated by the smoke, with piercing  
cries called for help to her dear, dear  
mother.--Alas! what could the un-  
happy parent do? whole sheets of  
flames rolled between them, while in  
a phrenzy of grief, she screamed out,  
"oh! my last treasure! my beloved  
Anna! try to escape the devouring  
fire--come to me my sweet child--  
the Indians will not kill us--Oh! my  
perishing babe! have pity on your  
mother--do not leave me quite desti-  
tute!" Then turning to the calm  
villains who attended her, she cried,  
"why do you not attempt to rescue  
my sweet innocent? can your unfeel-  
ing hearts not bear to leave me one--  
a solitary single one?” Again calling  
to her Anna, she received no answer,  
which being a presumption of her  
death, the Indiana obliged Maria and  
her brother Henry to quit the house,  
which they effected with some diffi-  
culty, the glowing beams falling a-  
round them, and thick volumes of  
smoke obscuring their passage; the  
flames now struck a long splendor  
through the humid atmosphere, and  
blushed to open the tragical scene on  
the face of Heaven. They had scarce  
advanced two hundred yards with  
their reluctant captives, when the  
flaming structure tumbled to the earth,  
with a dreadful crash. Our travelers  
by instinct turned their eyes to the  
mournful blaze, and Maria bursting  
afresh into grievous lamentations,  
cried, "there, there my brother!  
my children are wrapt in arching  
sheets of flames, that used to be cir-  
cled in my arms--they are entomb-  
ed in ruins that breathed their slum-  
bers on my bosom--yet, oh! their  
spotless souls even now rise from this  
chaos of blood and fire, and are plead-  
ing our injured cause before our God,  
my brother!" He replied only in  
sighs and groans--he scarcely heard  
her, horror had froze up the avenues  
of his soul, and all amazed and trem-  
bling, he followed his leaders like a  
person in a troublesome dream.  
The distant flames now cast a fain-  
ter light, and the northern breeze  
bent the columnes of smoke over the  
south horizon. Sad and benighted  
they wandered through almost impe-  
netrable swamps, forded the broad  
stream of Tomhanick, and the rapid  
river of Hosack; they passed through  
deserted settlements, where the yel-  
ling of solitary dogs increased the  
solemnity of midnight, nor halted  
till the stars, emitting a feebler lustre,  
presaged the approach of day. Maria,  
overcome by sorrow and fatigue, im-  
mediately sunk helpless at the foot of  
a tree, while the savages (who were  
six in number) kindled a fire, and  
prepared their meal, (in a calabash)  
which consisted only of some parched  
maize pulverized and enriched with  
the fat of bears flesh. Observing  
Maria had fallen asleep, they offered  
not to disturb her, but invited Henry  
Kittle to partake of their repast. He  
durst not refuse them, and having  
swallowed a few mouthfuls of their  
unpalatable food, and accepted of a  
pipe of tobacco, he desired leave to  
repose himself, which being readily  
granted, they soon followed his ex-  
ample, and sunk asleep, leaving two  
centinels to guard against surprise,  
which precaution they always make  
use of.  
  
I am sorry, dear Susan, to quit  
Maria in this interesting part of her  
history; but order requires that we  
should now return to her spouse,  
whom we left on his way through  
the wood.  
  
The village of Schochticook is  
situated on a circular plain, surround-  
ed by high hills, rising in form of an  
amphitheatre. Mr. Kittle had just  
gained the verge when, chancing to  
cast his eyes around, he perceived the  
whole southern hemisphere suddenly  
illuminated with a bright blaze;  
however, being accustomed to the  
forests being often fired to clear it  
from the under-wood, he was not  
much surprised, but proceeded to  
descend the hill. On his arriving  
with the account of his brother’s  
murder, the place was put in the  
highest commotion--the men fitting  
up their arms, and the women cla-  
mouring about them, highly impor-  
tunate to be removed to Albany; but  
the night being very dark, this man-  
oeuvre was deferred till morning;--  
nor could Mr. Kittle prevail on a  
single person to return with him dur-  
ing the darkness--he felt himself  
strangely agitated at this disappoint-  
ment, and refusing to repose himself,  
with great impatience he watched the  
first orient beam of Phosphor, which  
appearing, he sat off for home with  
two waggons and a guard of three  
Indians. As he approached his late  
happy dwelling, his bosom dilated  
with the pleasing hope of soon extra-  
cating his beloved family from dan-  
ger, he chid the slowness of the car-  
riages, and felt impatient to dissipate  
the apprehensions of Maria, to kiss  
the pendant tear from her eye, and  
press his sportive innocents to his bo-  
som. While these bright ideas play-  
ed round his soul, he lifted up his  
eyes, and through an opening in the  
woods beheld his farm--but what  
language can express his surprise and  
consternation at seeing his habitation  
so suddenly desolated! a loud ex-  
clamation of amaze burst from the  
whole company at so unexpected a  
view--the blood revolted from Mr.  
Kittle’s cheek--his heart throbbed  
under the big emotion, and all aghast,  
spurring on his horse, he entered the  
enclosure with full speed.--Stop here  
unhappy man! here let the fibres of  
thy heart crack with excruciating mi-  
sery--let the cruel view of mangled  
wretches, so nearly allied to thee,  
extort drops of blood from the cleav-  
ing bosom!--It did--it did. Utter-  
ing a deep groan he fell insensible  
from his horse, while his attendants,  
hastening towards him, were shocked  
beyond conception at the dismal spec-  
tacle, and starting back with averted  
eyes from the dead, were thunderstruck,  
not having power to move or speak.  
After a while two Indians (who be-  
ing used to sanguinary scenes, reco-  
vered themselves first) took a blanket,  
and walking backward to the man-  
gled Cornelia, threw it over her nak-  
ed body; the others then timidly ad-  
vanced, and Mr. Kittle opening his  
eyes, groaned again bitterly; then  
raising himself on his knees, with a  
look of unutterable anguish he called  
upon his dear Maria. Alas! No  
voice, but the solemn repetition of  
his own cries were articulated to him:  
then rising with an air of distraction,  
he stalked round the bloody scene,  
and examined the dead bodies, first  
uncovering the pale visage of Corne-  
lia, he surveyed in silence her dis-  
torted features; but perceiving it was  
not Maria, he gently laid the cloth  
over again, and turning furiously,  
caught up his ghastly infant, whose  
little body was black with contusions,  
and his skull horribly fractured. Al-  
most fainting under his mournful  
load, and staggering at the dreadful  
discovery, he deposited it again on  
the bloody earth, and clapping his  
hands together repeatedly with vio-  
lence, oh hell! hell! he cried, you  
cannot inflict torments so exquisite as  
those I now suffer! how am I crush-  
ed to the center! how deeply am I  
degraded below the worms of the sod!  
Oh! my children! my children!  
where are you now? Oh! my wife!  
my Maria! the beloved of my bo-  
som, are you too fallen a sacrifice?  
Why do I survive these miseries, my  
God? how can mortality support  
them? Burst--burst my shrinking  
heart, and punish a wretch for not  
having died in the defence of such  
lovely and innocent beings! Oh!  
why was I absent in this fatal hour?  
why did not their groans vibrate on  
my soul that I might have flown to  
their aid? Thus wildly lamenting  
and wandering among the smoaking  
ruins, he picked up some of the cal-  
cined bones of his once beautiful  
Anna. At this sight despair shook  
his soul afresh, new agonies convuls-  
ed his features, and dropping the sad  
evidence of his miseries, he extend-  
ed his arms to Heaven, and roared  
out--revenge, great God! revenge if  
thou art just and kind as represented!  
Oh! that I had the power of an  
archangel to thunder eternal horrors  
on the guilty wretches who have blast-  
ed the bud of my happiness, who  
have darkened the brightest eyes that  
ever opened on the light!  
The men here interfering, to con-  
sole him observed, the bones were  
probably those of his brother Peter;  
but on finding his skeleton entire,  
Mr. Kittle insisted that it must have  
been Maria and Anna, who having  
hid themselves, had doubtless perish-  
ed in the flames. Again, in the fu-  
rious extravagance of passion, he tore  
the hair from his head, and casting  
himself prostrate on the ashes, he ga-  
thered the crumbling bones to his  
bosom, while the big drops of an-  
guish issued at every pore, till life,  
unable longer to sustain the mental  
conflict, suspended her powers, and  
once more deprived him of sensation.  
His companions having laid him on  
a wagon, now conferred together  
in what manner to proceed, and ap-  
prehending an attack from the sava-  
ges, they unanimously concluded to  
lay the dead bodies on the remaining  
carriage, and make the best of their  
way to Schochticook, which they  
accordingly performed with great  
silence and expedition.  
  
You may judge, my dear, what a  
panic the appearance of this mourn-  
ful cavalcade struck over the inhabit-  
ants of this defenseless village. Mr.  
Kittle was gently laid on a bed, and  
being let blood, his respiration be-  
came less obstructed, though he con-  
tinued senseless till his unfortunate  
family were interred.--Six weeks  
elapsed before he recovered any de-  
gree of strength; but even then he  
appeared pale and emaciated, like a  
second Lazarus; his disposition was  
entirely changed, his looks were  
fierce, his attitudes wild and extra-  
vagant, and his conversation, which  
formerly was sensible, commanding  
attention by a musical voice, now  
was incoherent, and his cadence deep  
and hollow, rather inspiring terror  
than any pleasing sensation. Thirst-  
ing for revenge, and perceiving that  
solitude only tended to corrode his  
moments with the blackest melancho-  
ly, he soon after entered the British  
service in the capacity of gentleman  
volunteer, and signalized himself by  
his prudence and intrepidity, attract-  
ing the particular notice of his officers,  
who being affection with his misfor-  
tones, proffered their services to him  
with so much friendship and candour,  
as obliged him to accept of them, and  
yet lightened the obligation.

But doubtless, my dear, your  
generous sensibility is alarmed  
at my silence about Mrs. Kittle; I  
think we left her reposing under a  
tree--she was the first that awaked  
as the sun began to exhale the crystal  
globules of morning, when half ris-  
ing, and reclining on her elbow, she  
surveyed the lovely landscape around  
her with a deep sigh; they were on  
an eminence that commanded an un-  
limited prospect of the country every  
way. The birds were cheerful; the  
deer bounded fearless over the hills;  
the meadows blushed with the ena-  
mel of Flora; but grief had sadden-  
ed every object in her sight--the  
whole creation seemed a dark blank  
to the fair mourner. Again recol-  
lection unlocked the sluices of her  
eyes, and her soft complaints disturb-  
ed her savage companions, who, ris-  
ing and kindling up the dying em-  
bers, began to prepare their victuals,  
which they invited her to partake of.  
This she declined with visible de-  
testation; and turning to her bro-  
ther, with the dignity of conscious  
merit in distress, “No,” said she,  
“I never will receive a morsel from  
those bloody hands yet dropping with  
recent murder!--let me perish--let  
the iron hand of famine first pinch  
out my vitals and send me after my  
children!” Notwithstanding this,  
Henry added his solicitations that  
she should accept of some refresh-  
ment, reminding her of the conse-  
quence of her fatal resolution, which  
could be deemed no otherwise than  
suicide. Finding this had no effect,  
he tried to touch her feelings on a  
softer key--“Remember, Maria,”  
said he, “you have a tender husband  
yet living; would you wish to deprive  
him of every earthly consolation?  
Would you add affliction to affliction,  
and after he has performed the sor-  
rowful obsequies of his children, to  
crush all his remaining hope by the  
news of your voluntary death? No,  
live my sister! be assured he will soon  
get us exchanged, when soft sympa-  
thies shall wash away your sorrows,  
and after a few years, who knows  
but the smiles of a new lovely pro-  
geny may again dawn a paradise of  
happiness on you.” Maria was af-  
fected, and half raising her eyes from  
the earth, she replied, “Oh, my bro-  
ther! How consoling do your words  
sink on my heart! Though my reason  
tells me your arguments are impro-  
bable and fallacious, yet it soothes  
the tempest of my soul--I will try  
to live--perhaps I may again behold  
my dear--dear--dear--husband!”  
Here a flood of tears interrupted her.  
As this conversation was held in  
English, the savages were inquisitive  
to know the subject of it, at the same  
time enjoining them both never to  
utter a syllable in the presence except  
in their own uncouth dialect, which,  
as they perfectly understood, they  
could not excuse themselves from.  
Henry then informed them that his  
sister, objecting to their method of  
preparing food, had desired him to  
prevail with them to indulge her in  
dressing her meals herself. This they  
readily granted, and farther to ingra-  
tiate themselves in the prisoners’ fa-  
vour, they dispatched a young Indi-  
an to hunt for partridges or quails  
in the groves adjoining them: He  
instantly returned with a brood of  
wood-pigeons, scarcely fledged,  
which he presented to Henry, who  
cleaned and broiled them on sticks,  
with an officious solicitude to please  
his sister, which she observed with a  
look of gratitude, and taking a pi-  
geon from the stick, began to eat  
more from complaisance than incli-  
nation. Henry was delighted at her  
ready acquiescence, and their repast  
being ended, they proceeded on their  
tiresome journey with less repining  
than the preceding night. Maria  
was exempted from carrying a bur-  
den, yet she found the fatigue almost  
intolerable. They continually passed  
through a scene of conflagration, the  
savages firing every cottage in their  
way, whose mournful blaze catching  
the dry fields of grain, would scorch  
off hundred of acres in a few mo-  
ments, and form a burning path for  
their destroyers. As the sun ad-  
vanced to his zenith, its rays beat  
fiercely on our travelers, augmented  
by the crackling flames around them;  
when meeting with a cool stream of  
water, Maria was commanded to sit  
down (being overheated) while the  
rest approached the rivulet; the In-  
dian that guarded Maria was stoop-  
ing down to drink, when a loud rust-  
ling among the leaves, and trampling  
of bushes attracted his attention; he  
listened awhile seemingly much a-  
larmed, then starting up suddenly, he  
flew to Maria, and caught hold of  
her hair, aiming his hatchet at her  
head: the consequence was obvious,  
and her fate seemed inevitable; yet,  
with a stoical composure, she folded  
her arms across, and waited the fatal  
stroke with perfect resignation; but  
while the weapon was yet suspended  
over her, chancing to look around,  
he perceived the noise to proceed from  
a large deer, whose antlers were in-  
tangled in the branches of a thicket.  
Though an uncivilized inhabitant of  
the forest, he blushed at his precipi-  
tancy, and returning the instrument  
of death to his girdle, after some he-  
sitation made this apology: “Maria,  
this sudden discovery is well for you;  
I thought we had been pursued, and  
we never suffer our prisoners to be re-  
taken; however, I was imprudent to  
attempt your life before there was a  
probability of your being rescued:”  
then desiring her to rise and drink,  
he quickly shot the deer, his associ-  
ates helping him to skin it. Instead  
of quenching her thirst she sat down  
pensive on the flowery margin, cast-  
ing her eyes carelessly on the stream;  
she knew not whether to esteem her  
late deliverance from death a happy  
providence or protraction of misery.  
Observing the spotted trout, and other  
fish, to dart sportively across the wa-  
ter, she could not help exclaiming,  
“Happy! happy animals! you have  
not the fatal gift of reason to embitter  
your pleasures; you cannot anticipate  
your difficulties by apprehension, or  
prolong them by recollection; inca-  
pable of offending your Creator, the  
blessings of your existence are secur-  
ed to you: Alas! I envy the mean-  
est among ye!” A gush of tears  
concluded her soliloquy; and being  
called to attend the company, she  
arose, and they began their journey  
for the afternoon. Henry desiring to  
have a piece of venison (having left it  
behind, seldom incommoding them-  
selves with more than the hide and  
tallow) they returned and obliged  
him with a haunch, which was very  
fat: at the next interval of travel he  
dressed it for himself and Maria. In  
the evening they crossed the river  
somewhat below Fort-Edward, in a  
canoe left hid under some bushes for  
that purpose. They observed the  
most profound silence until the en-  
tered the woods again; but it was  
very late before they halted, which  
they did in a deep hollow, surround-  
ed by pines whose tops seemed to be  
lost in the clouds. It was necessary  
here to light a fire, for the wolves  
howled most dreadfully, and the  
whole forest rung with the cries of  
wild beasts of various sorts. The con-  
fines of hell could not have given  
Maria more dismal ideas than her  
present situation; the horrid gloom of  
the place, the scowling looks of her  
murderous companions, the shrill  
shrieks of owls, the loud cries of the  
wolf, and mournful screams of pan-  
thers, which were redoubled by dis-  
tant echoes, as the terrible sounds  
seemed dying away, shook her frame  
with cold tremors: she sunk under  
the oppression of terror, and almost  
fainted in Henry’s arms: however,  
on perceiving the beasts durst not ap-  
proach the light, but began to retire,  
she became a little more assured, and  
helped Henry to erect a booth of pine  
branches, making a bed of the same  
materials in it while he prepared their  
supper; having eaten, and kindled a  
large fire in the front of her arbour,  
she laid down and soon fell in a deep  
sleep; she felt herself refreshed by  
this unexpected repose, and the next  
morning, with some alacrity, conti-  
nued her journey, hoping at last to  
arrive at some Christian settlement.  
Arriving at Lake-Champlain, they  
raised a wigwam on the bank, ex-  
pecting the coming of Indians from  
the opposite shore to carry them over.  
Here our unfortunate captives were  
stript of their habits, already rent to  
pieces by briers, and attired each  
with remnants of old blankets. In  
this new distress Mrs. Kittle ventur-  
ed to expostulate with the savages,  
but it was talking to the stormy oce-  
an; her complaints served only to di-  
vert them; so retiring among the  
bushes, she adjusted her coarse dress  
somewhat decently, and then seating  
herself silently under a spreading tree,  
indulged herself in the luxury of sor-  
row. Henry, sensible that they es-  
pected more fortitude from him, and  
that if he sunk under his adverse for-  
tune, he should be worse treaded,  
affected to be cheerful; he assisted  
them in catching salmon, with which  
the lake abounds; an incredible  
quantity of wild fowl frequenting  
the lake also, he laid snares for those  
of the lesser sort, (not being allowed  
fire-arms) and succeeded so well, that  
his dexterity was highly commended,  
and night coming on, they regaled  
themselves on the fruits of their in-  
dustry. The night was exceedingly  
dark, but calm; a thick mist hovered  
over the woods, and the small ridgy  
waves softly rolled to the shore, when  
suddenly a large meteor, or fiery ex-  
halation, passed by them with sur-  
prising velocity, casting on every side  
showers of brilliant sparkles. At  
sight of this phaenomenon, the Indians  
put their heads between their knees,  
crying out in a lamentable voice,  
“Do not--do not--do not!” con-  
tinuing in the same attitude until the  
vapour disappeared. Henry, with  
some surprise, demanded the reason  
of this exclamation; to which they  
replied, “What he had seen was a  
fiery dragon, on his passage to his  
den, who was of so malevolent a  
temper, that he never failed, on his  
arrival there, to inflict some peculiar  
calamity on mankind.” In about  
five minutes after the earth was vio-  
lently agitated, the waves of the lake  
tumbled about in a strange manner,  
seeming to emit flashes of fire, all  
the while attended with most tremen-  
dous roarings, intermixed with loud  
noises, not unlike the explosion of  
heavy cannon. Soon as the Indians  
perceived it was an earthquake, they  
cried out, “Now he comes home!”  
and casting themselves in their former  
posture, filled the air with dismal  
howlings. This was a terrible scene  
to Maria, who had never been wit-  
ness to so dreadful a convulsion of  
nature before; she started up and fled  
from her savage companions towards  
an eminence at some distance, where  
dropping on her knees, she empha-  
tically implored the protection of  
Heaven: however, she was followed  
by an Indian and Henry; the latter  
highly affected with her distresses,  
taking hold of her trembling hand,  
“But why, my sister!” said he  
“have you fled from us? is the gloom  
of a forest more chearing than the  
sympathizing looks of a friend?”  
“No, my brother!” replied Maria,  
“but the thought was suggested to  
me, that the supreme God perhaps  
was preparing to avenge himself of  
these murderers by some awful and  
uncommon judgment, and I fled from  
them as Lot did from Sodom, lest I  
might be involved in the punishment  
of their guilt.” They conversed in  
English, which displeasing the Indi-  
an, he ordered them to return to the  
wigwam, threatening to bind Maria  
fast if she offered to elope again. The  
shock being over, silence again spread  
through the realms of darkness, when  
a high wind arose from the north and  
chilled our half-naked travelers with  
excessive cold. The savages, (whose  
callous skins were proof against the  
inclement weather) not caring to  
continue their fires, lest they should  
be discovered and surprised by some  
English party, they passed here a  
very uncomfortable night; but the  
wind subsiding, and the sky growing  
clear, the sun rose peculiarly warm  
and pleasant, streaming ten thousand  
rays of gold across the lake. Maria  
had scarcely performed her oraisons,  
when the savages, forming a circle  
round her and Henry, began to dance  
in a most extravagant manner, and  
with antic gestures that at another  
time would have afforded mirth to  
our travelers. Having continued  
their exercise some time, they incon-  
tinently drew out boxes of paint,  
and began to ornament their captives  
with a variety of colours; one hav-  
ing crossed their faces with a stroke  
of vermillion, another would inter-  
sect it with a line of black, and so  
on until the whole company had  
given a specimen of their skill or  
fancy.  
  
Soon after two canoes arrived, in  
which they passed over the lake,  
which was uncommonly serene and  
pleasant. They proceeded not far  
on their way before they were ob-  
liged to halt for two days, on account  
of Maria’s inability to travel, her  
feet being greatly swollen and lace-  
rated by the flinty path. At length,  
by easy stages, they came in view of  
an Indian settlement, when Maria’s  
long unbent features relaxed into a  
half smile, and turning to Henry,  
“Here, my brother!” said she, “I  
shall find some of my own sex, to  
whom simple nature, no doubt, has  
taught humanity; this is the first pre-  
cept she inculcates in the female  
mind, and this they generally retain  
through life, in spite of every evil  
propensity.” As she uttered this  
elogium in favour of the fair, the  
tawny villagers, perceiving their ap-  
proach, rushed promiscuously from  
their huts with a execrable din, and  
fell upon the weary captives with  
clubs and a shower of stones, accom-  
panying their strokes with the most  
virulent language; among the rest an  
old deformed squaw, with the rage  
of a Tisiphone, flew to Maria, aim-  
ing a pine-knot at her head, and  
would certainly have given the  
wretched mourner her quietus had  
she not been opposed by the savage  
that guarded Mrs. Kittle: he at first  
mildly expostulated with his passion-  
ate countrywoman; but finding the  
old hag frantic, and insatiable of  
blood, he twisted the pine-know from  
her hand, and whirled it away to  
some distance, then seizing her arm  
roughly, and tripping up her heels,  
he laid her prostrate, leaving her to  
howl and yell at leisure, which she  
performed without a prompter.--  
Maria was all in a tremor, and has-  
tily followed her deliverer, not car-  
ing to risk another encounter with  
the exasperated virago. By this time  
the rage and tumult of the savages  
subsiding, the new-comers were ad-  
mitted into a large wigwam, in the  
center of which blazed a fire. After  
they were seated, several young In-  
dians entered with baskets of green  
maize in the ear, which, having roast-  
ed before the fire, they distributed  
among the company.  
  
Mrs. Kittle and her brother com-  
plaining of the bruises they met with  
at their reception, an old Indian  
seemed to attend with great concern,  
then leaving the place, in a little time  
returned with a bundle of aromatic  
herbs under his arm, the juice of  
which, he expressed by rubbing them  
between two stones with flat surfaces;  
this he gave them to drink, applying  
the leaves externally. They instant-  
ly found relief from the medical qua-  
lity of this extraordinary plant, and  
composing themselves to sleep, ex-  
pected a good night’s repose; but  
they were mistaken, for their enter-  
tainers growing intoxicated with spi-  
rituous liquors, which operating dif-  
ferently, it produced a most compli-  
cated noise of yelling, talking, sing-  
ing, and quarrelling: this was a  
charm more powerful than the wand  
of Hermes to drive away sleep; but  
grown familiar with sorrow and dis-  
appointment, Maria regarded this as  
a trifle, and when Henry expressed  
his concern for her, smiling, replied,  
“We must arm ourselves with pati-  
ence, my brother! we can combat  
with fate in no other manner.”  
  
It were endless to recapitulate mi-  
nutely every distress that attended the  
prisoners in their tedious journey; let  
it suffice, that having passed through  
uncommon misery, and imminent  
danger, they arrived at Montreal.  
Here the savages were joined by seve-  
ral scalping parties of their tribe, and  
having previously fresh painted them-  
selves, appeared in hideous pomp, and  
performed a kind of triumphal entry.  
The throng of people that came out  
to meet them threw Maria in the most  
painful sensations of embarrassment;  
but as the clamours and insults of the  
populace encreased, a freezing tor-  
por succeeded, and bedewed her  
limbs with a cold sweat--strange chi-  
meras danced before her sight--the  
actings of her soul were suspended  
--she seemed to move mechanically,  
nor recollected herself till she found  
she was seated in the Governor’s hall,  
surrounded by an impertinent, inqui-  
sitive circle of people, who were en-  
quiring into the cause of her disor-  
der, without attempting any thing  
towards her relief. Discovering her  
situation, she blushingly withdrew to  
a dark corner from the public gaze,  
and could not help sighing to herself,  
“Alas! but a very few days ago I  
was hailed as the happiest of women  
--my fond husband anticipated all  
my desires--my children smiled  
round me with filial delight--my  
very servants paid me the homage  
due to an angel--oh! my God!  
what a sudden, what a deplorable  
transition! I am fallen below con-  
tempt.” As she thus moralized on  
her situation, an English woman  
(whom humanity more than curiosi-  
ty had drawn to the place) approach-  
ed Maria, and observing her tears and  
deep dejection, took hold of her hand,  
and endeavoured to smile, but the  
soft impulses of nature were too strong  
for the efforts of dissimulation--her  
features instantly saddened again, and  
she burst into tears, exclaiming, (with  
a hesitating voice,) “Poor, forlorn  
creature! where are thy friends!  
perhaps the dying moments of thy  
fond parent, or husband, have been  
cruelly embittered with the sight of  
thy captivity! perhaps now thy help-  
less orphan is mourning for the breast  
which gave him nourishment! or thy  
plaintive little ones are wondering at  
the long absence of their miserable  
mother!”--“Oh! no more! no  
more!” interrupted Maria, “your  
pity is severer than savage cruelty--I  
could stand the shock of fortune with  
some degree of firmness, but your  
soft sympathy opens afresh the wounds  
of my soul! my losses are beyond  
your conjecture--I have no parent!  
no sportive children! and, I believe,  
no husband! to mourn and wish for  
me.” These words were succeeded  
by an affecting silence on both sides:  
mean while the Indians testified their  
impatience to be admitted to the  
Governor by frequent shouts; at  
Length his Excellency appeared, and  
Having held a long conference with  
The savages, they retired with his Se-  
cretary, and our prisoners saw them  
no more.

After their exit the Governor  
Turning round to Maria and  
Henry, demanded who they were?  
Mrs. Kittle’s perplexity prevented  
her reply; but Henry, in a most re-  
spectful manner, gave him a succinct  
account of their misfortunes. The  
Governor perceiving him sensible and  
communicative, interrogated him far-  
ther, but he modestly declined giv-  
ing any political intelligence. Ob-  
serving that Maria suffered greatly in  
this interview, he soon concluded it,  
after having presented several pieces  
of callicoes and stuffs to them, desir-  
ing they would accept what they had  
occasion for. Mrs. Kittle immedi-  
ately singled out a piece of black cal-  
limanco with tears of gratitude to  
her benefactor; who, smiling, ob-  
served she might chuse a gayer co-  
lour, as he hoped her distresses were  
now over. Maria shook her head in  
token of dissent, but could make no  
reply. He then dismissed them, with  
a small guard, who was directed to  
provide them with decent lodging.  
Henry was accommodated at a  
bakers, while his sister, to her no  
small satisfaction, found herself plac-  
ed at the English woman’s who, on  
her arrival, had expressed so much  
good nature.--She had scarcely en-  
tered, when Mrs. D.--, presenting  
her with a cordial, led her to a couch,  
insisting on her reposing there a little,  
“for,” says she, “your waste of  
spirits requires it.”  
  
This tenderness, which Maria had  
long been a stranger to, relaxed every  
fibre of her heart: She again melted  
into tears; but it was a gush of grate-  
ful acknowledgment, that called a  
modest blush of pleasure and per-  
plexity on Mrs. D--‘s check. Be-  
ing left alone, she soon fell in a pro-  
found sleep; and her friend having  
prepared a comfortable repast, in less  
than an hour awaked her, with an  
invitation to dinner--“and how do  
you find yourself, my sister?” said  
she instinctively, seizing Maria’s hand  
and compressing it between hers;  
“may we hope that you will assist  
us in conquering your dejection?”--  
Maria smiled benignly through a  
chrystal atmosphere of tears, and kis-  
sing the hand of her friend, arose.  
Having dined, and being now equip-  
ped in decent apparel, Maria became  
the admiration and esteem of the  
whole family. The tempest of her  
soul subsided in a solemn calm; and  
though she did not regain her viva-  
city, she became agreeably convers-  
able.  
  
In a few days, however, she felt  
the symptoms of an approaching fe-  
ver. She was alarmed at this, and  
intimated to Mrs. D--her fears  
of becoming troublesome. “Do not  
be concerned,” returned that kind  
creature; “my God did not plant  
humanity in my breast to remain there  
an inactive principle.” Maria felt  
her oppression relieved by this gene-  
rous sentiment; and indeed found her  
friendship did not consist in profess-  
sion, as she incessantly tended her  
during her illness with inexpressible  
delicacy and solicitude. When she  
was again on the recovery, Mrs.  
D--one day ordered a small truck  
covered with Morocco leather to be  
brought before her, and opening it,  
produced several sets of fine linen,  
with some elegant stuffs and other  
necessaries--“See,” said she, “what  
the benevolence of Montreal has done  
for you. The ladies that beg your  
acceptance of these things, intend  
likewise to inhance the favour, by  
waiting on you this afternoon.”--  
“Ah!” interrupted Maria, “I want  
Them not; this one plain habit is  
enough to answer the purpose of  
dress for me. Shut the chest my dear  
Mrs. D--, and keep them as a  
small compensation for the immense  
trouble I have been to you.”--“If  
this is your real sentiment,” replied  
her friend, (shutting the chest, and  
presenting her the key,) “return  
your gifts to the donors; and since  
you will reward me for my little of-  
fices of friendship, only love me, and  
believe me disinterested, and I shall  
be overpaid.”--“I see I have wrong-  
ed your generosity,” answered Maria.  
“Pardon me, my sister, I will offend  
no more. I did not think you mer-  
cinary--but--but--I meant only to  
disengage my heart of a little of its  
burden.”--As this tender contest was  
painful to both parties, Mrs. D--  
rising abruptly, pretended some bu-  
siness, promising to return again di-  
rectly.  
  
In the afternoon Maria received  
her visitants in a neat little parlour.  
She was dressed in a plain suit of  
mourning, and wore a small muslin  
cap, from which her hair fell in art-  
less curls on her fine neck: her face  
was pale, though not emaciated, and  
her eyes streamed a soft languor over  
her countenance, more bewitching  
than the sprightliest glances of viva-  
city. As they entered she arose, and  
advancing, modestly received their  
civilities, while Mrs. D--handed  
them to chairs: But hearing a well-  
known voice, she hastily lifted up her  
eyes, and screamed out in an accent  
of surprise, “Good Heaven! May  
I credit my senses? My dear Mrs.  
Bratt, my kind neighbor, is it re-  
ally you that I see?” Here she found  
herself clasped in her friend’s arms,  
who, after a long subsiding sigh,  
broke into tears. The tumult of pas-  
sion at length abating--“Could I  
have guessed, my Maria,” said she,  
“that you was here, my visit should  
not have been deferred a moment af-  
ter your arrival; but I have mourn-  
ed with a sister in affliction, (permit  
me to present her to you,) and while  
our hearts were wrung with each  
other’s distress, alas! we enquired  
after no foreign calamity.” Being  
all seated, “I dare not,” resumed  
Maria, “ask after your family; I  
am afraid you only have escaped to  
tell me of them.” Not so, my sister,”  
cried Mrs. Bratt; “but if you can  
bear the recollection of your misfor-  
tunes, do oblige me with the recital.”  
The ladies joined their entreaty, and  
Mrs. Kittle complied in a graceful  
manner.  
  
After some time spent in tears,  
and pleasing melancholy, tea was  
brought in; and towards sun-set Mrs.  
D--invited the company to walk  
in the garden, which being very  
small, consisted only of a parterre, at  
the farther end of which stood an  
arbour covered with a grape-vine.  
Here being seated, after some chat  
on indifferent subjects, Maria desired  
Mrs. Bratt (if agreeable to the com-  
pany) to acquaint her with the cir-  
cumstances of her capture. They all  
bowed approbation; and after some  
hesitation Mrs. Bratt began:--  
“My heart, ladies, shall ever re-  
tain a sense of the happiness I enjoy-  
ed in the society of Mrs. Kittle and  
several other amiable persons in the  
vicinage of Schochticook, where I  
resided. She in particular cheered  
my lonely hours of widowhood, and  
omitted nothing that she thought  
might conduce to my serenity. I had  
two sons; she recommended the edu-  
cation of them to my leisure hours.  
I accepted of her advice, and found  
a suspension of my sorrows in the  
execution of my duty. They soon  
improved beyond my capacity of  
teaching. Richard, my eldest, was  
passionately fond of books, which he  
studied with intense application.  
This naturally attached him to a se-  
dentary life, and he became the con-  
stant instructive companion of me  
evening hours. My youngest son,  
Charles, was more volatile, yet not  
less agreeable; his person was charm-  
ing, his wit sprightly, and his ad-  
dress elegant. They often impor-  
tuned me, at the commencement of  
this war, to withdraw to Albany;  
but as I apprehended no danger, (the  
British troops being stationed above  
us, quite from Saratoga to the Lake)  
I ridiculed their fears.  
  
“One evening as my sons were  
come in from reaping, and I was  
busied in preparing them a dish of  
tea, we were surprised by a discharge  
of musketry near us. We all three  
ran to the door, and beheld a party  
of Indians not twenty paces from us.  
Struck with astonishment, we had no  
power to move, and the savages again  
firing that instant, my Charles drop-  
ped down dead beside me. Good  
God! what were my emotions?  
  
But language would fail, should I  
attempt to describe them. My sur-  
viving son then turning to me, with  
a countenance expressive of the deep-  
est horror urged me to fly. “Let  
us begone this instant,” said he; “a  
moment determines our fate. O!  
my mother! you are already lost.”  
But despair had swallowed up my  
fears; I fell shrieking on the body of  
my child, and rending away my hair,  
endeavoured to recall him to life with  
unavailing laments. Richard in the  
mean while had quitted me, and the  
moment after I beheld him mounted  
on horseback, and stretching away to  
the city. The Indians fired a volley  
at him, but missed, and I flatter my-  
self that he arrived safe--And now,  
not all my prayers and tears could  
prevent the wretches from scalping  
my precious child. But when they  
rent me away from him, and dragged  
me from the house, my grief and  
rage burst forth like a hurricane. I  
execrated their whole race, and called  
for eternal vengeance to crush them  
to atoms. After a while I grew a-  
shamed of my impetuosity; the tears  
began again to flow silently on my  
brow, and as I walked through the  
forest between two Indians, my soul  
grew suddenly sick and groaned in  
me; a darkness more substantial than  
Egyptian night fell upon it, and my  
existence became an insupportable  
burthen to me. I looked up to Hea-  
ven with a hopeless kind of awe, but  
I murmured no more at the dispensa-  
tions of my God, and in this frame  
of sullen resignation I passed the rest  
of my journey, which being nearly  
similar to Mrs. Kittle’s, I shall aboid  
the repetition of. And now permit  
me (said she, turning to the French  
ladies) to acknowledge your extreme  
goodness to me. I was a stranger,  
sick and naked, and you took me in.  
You indeed have proved the good Sa-  
maritan to me, pouring oil and wine  
in my wounds.” “Hush! hush!”  
cried Madame de Roche, “you esti-  
mate our services at too high a rate.  
I see you are no connoisseur in minds;  
there is a great deal of honest hospi-  
tality in the world, though you have  
met with so little.”  
  
“I now reject,” interrupted Mrs.  
Bratt, “all prejudices of education.  
From my infancy have I been taught  
that the French were a cruel perfidi-  
ous enemy, but I have found them  
quite the reverse.”  
  
Madame de R. willing to change  
the subject, accosted the other stran-  
ger--“Dear Mrs. Willis, shall we  
not be interested likewise in your  
misfortunes?”--“Ah! do,” added  
Mademoiselle V. “my heart is now  
sweetly tuned to melancholly. I love  
to indulge these divine sensibilities,  
which your affecting histories are so  
capable of inspiring.” –Maria then  
took hold of Mrs. Willis’s hand, and  
pressed her to oblige them.--Mrs.  
Willis bowed. She dropt a few tears;  
but assuming a composed look, she  
began--

“I am the daughter of a poor  
clergyman, who being con-  
fined to his chamber, by sickness, for  
several years, amused himself by edu-  
cating me. At his death, finding  
myself friendless, and without mo-  
ney, I accepted the hand of a young  
man who had taken a leased farm in  
Pennsylvania. He was very agree-  
able, and extravagantly fond of me.  
We lived happily for many years in  
a kind of frugal affluence. When  
the savages began to commit out-  
rages on the frontier settlements, our  
neighbours, intimidated at their ra-  
pid approaches, erected a small fort,  
surrounded by a high palisade. Into  
this the more timorous drove their  
cattle at night; and one evening, as  
we were at supper, my husband (be-  
ing ordered on guard) insisted that I  
should accompany him with the chil-  
dren (for I had two lovely girls, one  
turned of thirteen years, and another  
of six months.) My Sophia assented  
to the proposal with joy. “Mamma,”  
said she, “what a merry woman the  
Captain’s wife is; she will divert us  
the whole evening, and she is very  
fond of your company: come, I  
will take our little Charlotte on my  
arm, and papa will carry the lan-  
thorn.” I acceded with a nod; and  
already the dear charmer had hand-  
ed me my hat and gloves, when some-  
body thundered at the door. We  
were silent as death, and instantly  
after plainly could distinguish the  
voices of savages conferring together.  
Chilled as I was with fear, I flew to  
the cradle, and catching my infant,  
ran up into a loft. Sophia followed  
me all trembling, and panting for  
breath cast herself in my bosom.  
Hearing the Indians enter, I looked  
through a crevice in the floor, and  
saw them, with menacing looks, seat  
themselves round the table, and now  
and then addressed themselves to Mr.  
Willis, who, all pale and astonished,  
neither understood nor had power to  
answer them. I observed they took  
a great pleasure in terrifying him,  
by flourishing their knives, and gash-  
ing the table with their hatchets.  
Alas! this sight shot icicles to my  
soul; and, to increase my distress,  
my Sophia’s little heart beat against  
my breath, with redoubled strokes, at  
every word they uttered.  
  
“Having finished their repast in  
a gluttinous manner, they laid a fire-  
brand in each corner of the chamber,  
and then departed, driving poor Mr.  
Willis before them. The smoke soon  
incommoded us; but we dreaded our  
barbarous enemy more than the fire.  
At length, however, the flames be-  
ginning to invade our retreat, trem-  
bling and apprehensive we ventured  
down stairs; the whole house now  
glowed like a furnace; the flames  
rolled towards the stairs, which we  
hastily descended; but just as I sat  
my foot on the threshold of the door,  
a piece of timber, nearly consumed  
through, gave way, and fell on my  
left arm, which supported my infant,  
miserably fracturing the bone. I in-  
stantly caught up my fallen lamb,  
and hasted to overtake my Sophia.  
There was a large hollow tree conti-  
guous to our house, with an aperture  
just large enough to admit so small a  
woman as I am. Here we had often  
laughingly proposed to hide our chil-  
dren, in case of a visit from the olive  
coloured natives. In this we now  
took shelter; and being seated some  
time, my soul seemed to awake as  
it were from a vision of horror: I  
lifted up my eyes, and beheld the  
cottage that lately circumscribed all  
my worldly wealth and delight,  
melting away before the devouring  
fire. I dropt a tear as our apostate  
first parents did when thrust out from  
Eden.  
  
“The world lay all before them,  
where to chuse their place of rest,  
and Providence their guide. Ah!  
Eve thought I, hadst thou been like  
me, solitary, maimed, and unpro-  
tected, thy situation had been deplo-  
rable indeed. Then pressing my  
babe to my heart, “how quiet art  
thou, my angel,” said I; “sure--  
sure, Heaven has stilled thy little  
plaints in mercy to us.”--“Ah!”  
sobbed Sophia, “now I am com-  
forted again that I hear my dear  
mamma’s voice. I was afraid grief  
would have for ever deprived me of  
that happiness.” And here she kissed  
my babe and me with vehemence.  
When her transports were moderated,  
“how cold my sister is,” said she,  
“do wrap her up warmer, mamma;  
poor thing, she is not used to such  
uncomfortable lodging.”  
  
“The pain of my arm now called  
for all my fortitude and attention;  
but I forbore to mention this afflict-  
ing circumstance to my daughter.  
“The cheerful swallow now be-  
gan to usher in the dawn with melo-  
dy; we timidly prepared to quit our  
hiding place; and turning round to  
the light, I cast an anxious eye of  
love on my innocent, wondering  
that she slept so long. But oh! hor-  
ror and misery! I beheld her a pale,  
stiff corpse in my arms (suffer me to  
weep, ladies, at the cruel recollect-  
tion;) it seems the piece of wood  
that disabled me, had also crushed my  
Charlotte’s tender skull, and no won-  
der my hapless babe was quiet. I  
could no longer sustain my sorrowful  
burden, but falling prostrate, almost  
insensible, at the dreadful discovery,  
uttered nothing but groans. Sophia’s  
little heart was too susceptible for so  
moving a scene. Distracted between  
her concern for me, and her grief for  
the loss of her dear sister, she cast  
herself beside me, and with the soft-  
est voice of sorrow, bewailed the fate  
of her beloved Charlotte--her sweet  
companion--her innocent, laughing  
play-fellow. At length we rose,  
and Sophia, clasping all that remain-  
ed of my cherub in her arms, “Ah!”  
said she, “I did engage to carry you,  
my sister, but little did I expect in  
this distressing manner.” When we  
came in sight of the fort, though I  
endeavoured to spirit up my grieved  
child, yet I found my springs of ac-  
tion began to move heavily, my  
heart fluttered, and I suddenly faint-  
ed away. Sophia, concluding I was  
dead, uttered so piercing a cry, that  
the centinel looking up, immediate-  
ly called to those in the fort to assist  
us. When I recovered, I found m-  
self in a bed encircled by my kind  
neighbours, who divided their ex-  
pressions of love and condolement be-  
tween me and my child. I remain-  
ed in the fort after this; but, ladies,  
you may think, that bereft as I was  
of so kind a husband and endearing  
child, I soon found myself solitary  
and destitute. I wept incessantly;  
and hearing nothing from my dear  
Willis, I at length resolved to traverse  
the wilds of Canada in pursuit of  
him. When I communicated this to  
my friends, they all strongly oppos-  
ed it; but finding me inflexible, they  
furnished me with some money and  
necessaries, and obtained a permission  
from the Governor to let me go un-  
der protection of a flag that was on  
the way. Hearing likewise that a  
cartel was drawn for an exchange of  
prisoners, I sat out, flushed with hope,  
and with indefatigable industry and  
painful solicitude, arrived at Mon-  
treal, worn to a skeleton (as you see  
ladies) with fatigue.  
  
“I omitted not to enquire of every  
officer, the names of prisoners who  
had been brought in. At length I  
understood that Mr. Willis had pe-  
rished in jail, on his first arrival, of  
a dysentery.--Here my expectations  
terminated in despair. I had no mo-  
ney to return with, and indeed but  
for my Sophia no inclination--the  
whole world seemed dark and chear-  
less to me as the fabled region of Cim-  
meria, and I was nigh perishing for  
very want, when Mrs. Bratt, hearing  
of my distress, sought my acquaint-  
ance: she kindly participated my  
sorrows, and too--too generously  
shared her purse and bed with me.--  
This, ladies, is the story of a broken-  
hearted woman; nor should I have  
intruded it in any other but the house  
of mourning.”  
  
Here she concluded, while the  
ladies severally embracing her, ex-  
pressed their acknowledgements for  
the painful task she had complied  
with to oblige their curiosity--  
“Would to Heaven!” said Madame  
de R--, “that the brutal nations were  
extinct, for never--never can the  
united humanity of France and Bri-  
tain compensate for the horrid cruel-  
ties of their savage allies.”  
They were soon after summoned  
to an elegant collation; and having  
spent best part of the night together,  
the guests retired to their respective  
homes.  
  
During two years, in which the  
French ladies continued their boun-  
ty and friendship to Mrs. Kittle, she  
never could gain the least intelligence  
of her husband. Her letters, after  
wandering through several provinces,  
would often return to her hands un-  
opened. Despairing at length of ever  
seeing him, “ah!” she would say to  
Mrs. D--, “my poof husband has  
undoubtedly perished, perhaps in his  
fruitless search after me, and I am  
left to be a long--long burden on  
your goodness, a very unprofitable  
dependant.”  
  
In her friend’s absence she would  
descend into the kitchen, and submit  
to the most menial offices; nor could  
the servants prevent her; however,  
the apprised Mrs. D--of it, who  
seized an opportunity of detecting her  
at her labour. Being baffled in her  
humble attempt by the gentle re-  
proaches of her indulgent patroness,  
she sat down on the step of the door,  
and began to weep. “I believe,  
good Mrs. D--,” said she, “were  
you a hard task-master, that exacted  
from these useless hands the most sla-  
vish business, I could acquit myself  
with cheerfulness: my heart is like  
ice, that brightens and grows firmer  
by tempests, but cannot stand the  
warm rays of a kind sun.” Mrs.  
D--was beginning to answer,  
when hearing a tumult in the street,  
they both hasted to the door, and  
Maria, casting her eyes carelessly over  
the crowd, in an instant recognized  
the features of her long-lamented  
husband, who sprang towards her  
with an undescribable and involunta-  
ry rapture; but the tide of joy and  
surprise was too strong for the de-  
licacy of her frame. She gave a  
faint exclamation, and stretching out  
her arms to receive him, dropped  
senseless at his feet. The succession  
of his ideas were too rapid to admit  
describing. He caught her up, and  
bearing her in the hall, laid his pre-  
cious burden on a settee, kneeling be-  
side her in a speechless agony of de-  
light and concern. Mean while the  
spectators found themselves wonder-  
fully affected--the tender contagion  
ran from bosom to bosom--they wept  
aloud; and the house of joy seemed  
to be the house of lamentation. At  
length Maria opened her eyes and  
burst into a violent fit of tears--Mr.  
Kittle, with answering emotions, si-  
lently accompanying her; then clasp-  
ing his arms endearingly round her,  
“it is enough, my love,” said he;  
“we have had our night of affliction,  
and surely this blessed meeting is a  
presage of a long day of future hap-  
pines; let me kiss off those tears,  
and shew by your smiles that I am  
indeed welcome.” Maria then bend-  
ing fondly forward to his bosom, re-  
plied, sighing, “alas! how can your  
beggared wife give you a proper re-  
ception!--she cannot restore your  
prattling babes to your arms!--she  
comes alone--alas! her presence will  
only serve to remind you of the trea-  
sures--the filial delights you have  
lost.”--“God forbid,” answered he,  
“that I should repine at the loss of  
my smaller comforts, when so capital  
a blessing as my beloved Maria is so  
wonderfully restored to me.” Here  
he was in civility obliged to rise and  
receive the compliments of Mrs.  
Bratt, Mrs. Willis, and Madame de  
R--, who, hearing of his arrival,  
entered just then half breathless, with  
impatience and joy. The company  
encreased. An elegant dinner was  
prepared. In short, the day was de-  
voted to pleasure; and never was  
satisfaction more general--festivity  
glowed on every face, and compla-  
cency dimpled every cheek.  
After tea Maria withdrew in the  
garden, to give her beloved an ac-  
count of what had befallen her dur-  
ing their separation. The eloquence  
of sorrow is irresistible. Mr. Kittle  
wept, he groaned, while all impassi-  
oned (with long interruptions of grief  
in her voice) she stammered through  
her doleful history, and yet she felt  
a great satisfaction in pouring her  
complaints into a bosom whose feel-  
ings were in unison with her’s--they  
wept--the smiled--they mourned,  
and rejoiced alternately, with an  
abrupt transition from one passion to  
another.  
  
Mr. Kittle, in return, informed  
her, that having thrown himself  
into the army, in hopes of ending a  
being that grew insupportable under  
the reflection of past happiness--he  
tempted death in every action where-  
in he was engaged, and being dis-  
appointed, gave himself up to the  
blackest melancholy. “This gloomy  
scene,” he observed, “would soon  
have been closed by some act of des-  
peration, but one evening, sitting  
pensive in his tent, and attentively  
running over the circumstances of his  
misfortunes, a thought darted on his  
mind that possibly his brother Henry  
might be alive.” This was the first  
time the idea of any one of his fa-  
mily’s surviving the general murder  
had presented itself to him, and he  
caught at the flattering suggestion as  
a drowning wretch would to a plank.  
“Surely--surely,” said he, “my bro-  
ther lives--it is some divine emana-  
tion lights up the thought in my soul  
--it carries conviction with it--I  
will go after him--it shall be the  
comfort and employment of my life  
to find out this dear brother--this last  
and only treasure.” Persuaded of  
the reality of his fancy, he commu-  
nicated his design to a few of his mi-  
litary friends; but they only laughed  
at his extravagance, and strongly  
dissuaded him from so wild an un-  
dertaking. Being discouraged, he  
desisted; but shortly after, hearing  
that a company of prisoners (who  
were enfranchised) were returning to  
Quebec, he got permission to accom-  
pany them. After a very fatiguing  
journey he arrived at Montreal, and  
was immediately introduced to the  
General Officer, who patiently heard  
his story, and treated him with great  
clemency. Having obtained leave to  
remain a few days in town, he re-  
spectfully withdrew, and turning  
down a street, he enquired of a man  
who was walking before him, where  
lodgings were to be let? The stran-  
ger turned about, civily taking off  
his hat, when Mr. Kittle, starting  
back, grew as pale as ashes--“Oh,  
my God!” cried he, panting, “oh!  
Henry, is it you! is it indeed you!  
No, it cannot be!” Here he was  
ready to fall; but Henry, with little  
less agitation, supported him; and a  
tavern being at hand, he led him in.  
The master of the hotel brought in  
wine, and they drank off many glasses  
to congratulate so happy a meeting.  
When their transports were abated,  
Henry ventured to tell him that his  
Maria was living and well. This  
was a weight of joy too strong for  
his enfeebled powers--he stared wild-  
ly about. At length, recovering him-  
self, “take care, Henry,” said he,  
“this is too tender a point to trifle  
upon.”--“My brother,” replied  
Henry, “be calm, let not your joy  
have a worse effect than your grief--  
they both came sudden, and it be-  
hoves a man and a christian to shew  
as much fortitude under the one as  
the other.”--“Alas! I am prepared  
for some woeful deception,” cried  
Mr. Kittle; “but, Henry, this sus-  
pence is cruel.”--“By the eternal  
God!” rejoined his brother, “your  
Maria--your wife--is in this town,  
and if you are composed enough,  
shall immediately see her. Mr. Kit-  
tle could not speak--he gave his hand  
to Henry, and while (like the Apos-  
tles friends) he believed not for joy,  
he was conducted to her arms, and  
found his bliss wonderfully real.
