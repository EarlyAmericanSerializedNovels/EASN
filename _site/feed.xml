&lt;h3 id=&quot;preface-the-cruel-father&quot;&gt;Preface: The Cruel Father&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Cruel Father&lt;/em&gt; first appeared as a serialized long story in the &lt;em&gt;New-York Weekly Museum&lt;/em&gt;. It ran in four weekly installments between November 2, 1805 and November 23, 1805. No author was ascribed to the story, a common occurrence during this period when stories were often culled from other newspapers, periodicals, and literary sources. The anonymous author may also be due to the story enacting a common stereotype and trope which cuts across cultures and traditions—that of the cruel and tyrannical father. Many other serialized stories appear during the early American era named &lt;em&gt;The Cruel Father&lt;/em&gt; which contain the same general motif, but are comprised of different characters and different plotlines. The cruel father also appears as a stock character in numerous other tales and stories of the same time period. While the serialized form appeared in numerous variations in other periodicals, it was also pirated by Russell Ladd in 1812 and printed in Philadelphia in novel form as a prefix to another pirated serialized story, &lt;em&gt;Albert and Eliza.&lt;/em&gt; This novelized format from 1812 is the version most readers are familiar with (although the story remains for the most part, unknown), and is nearly identical in characters and plotlines to the edition which appeared first in the &lt;em&gt;New-York Weekly Museum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New-York Weekly Museum&lt;/em&gt; was a popular newspaper in New York City. The newspaper began May 17, 1788 as the &lt;em&gt;Impartial Gazeteer&lt;/em&gt; by John Harrison and Stephen Purdy, booksellers in the city. In their introductory edition, the booksellers announced the availability of a number of widely popular children’s books for sale at their bookstore. The publishers assured readers in this first edition that their aim was to “promote the amusement of its readers” and avoid content that would “offend the modest or disturb the feelings of the Virtuous.” The following September in 1789, printers convinced Harrison and Purdy that the content of the weekly periodical failed to match the title of the newspaper. The &lt;em&gt;Impartial Gazeteer&lt;/em&gt; became the &lt;em&gt;New-York Weekly Museum.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After changing its title to more accurately reflect content, the newspaper catered to a female audience. The &lt;em&gt;New-York Weekly Museum&lt;/em&gt; proved to be popular and profitable, as well as enduring in a time when newspapers, magazines, and periodicals speedily came and went. The newspaper’s reputation among women grew due to the “true” and “moral” sentimental stories it published. At the end of each year, the most popular of the serialized stories were gathered into bound and printed volumes, advertised, and sold in Harrison and Purdy’s bookstore. Additionally, the newspaper contained prose, poetry, moral lessons, advice, and advertising all aimed at the polite and refined female society of New York City. Although the newspaper was chiefly a literary magazine, it also contained paragraphs of news, theatrical announcements, and advice for women in the form of verse. It was during this period of the newspaper’s existence that &lt;em&gt;The Cruel Father&lt;/em&gt; appeared in its pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advertisements aimed at attracting attention of the intended audience were also included alongside literary content. These included notices about runaway slaves, gossip columns, and death and marriage notices. The death notices generally announced deaths of a particularly gruesome, mysterious, or lurid sort. Murdered children, suicides, unfaithful spouses, seduced young girls, and deaths of foreigners generally rounded out such announcements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The paper operated under the direction of Harrison and Purdy until 1791, at which time Purdy withdrew his financial interests and control. In 1804, Harrison died, leaving the newspaper in the control of his widow and eldest son. In 1814, the paper was taken over by James Oram, who took exception to the name. He experimented by adding a subtitle, essentially changing the name to &lt;em&gt;New-York Weekly Museum, or, Polite Repository for Amusement and Instruction, Being an Assemblage of whatever can tend to interest the Mind or exalt the character of the American Fair&lt;/em&gt;.” In 1817, he shortened the title to the simple, but direct, &lt;em&gt;Ladies’ Weekly Museum&lt;/em&gt;. Shortly thereafter, Oram announced that rivaling newspaper editor, Alexander Ming bought the publication and merged it with his own newspaper, the &lt;em&gt;Weekly Visitor&lt;/em&gt;. The &lt;em&gt;New-York Weekly Museum&lt;/em&gt;, an independent newspaper for twenty-nine years, was subsumed by Ming and became a part of the new newspaper, &lt;em&gt;Weekly Visitor and Ladies’ Museum&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That &lt;em&gt;The Cruel Father&lt;/em&gt; would appear in the &lt;em&gt;New-York Weekly&lt;/em&gt; is somewhat surprising. The tale is a moral tale, but one aimed at husbands and fathers instead of women. It relates the story of a young woman who marries a greedy man named Malvolio, whose only love in life is money. His avarice and violent nature cause a series of calamitous events for those closest to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In serial form, this story served to entertain readers. Readers of either gender would enjoy the familiarity of the common morality tale—warning of greed, avarice, cruelty. The installments ended in the midst of moments of suspense, urging readers to buy the next installment in order to find out what happened next. The common elements and themes in the story made it a good choice for serializing, as the plotlines were recognized and familiar, helping readers easily conjecture what was coming next. The sentimentality of the story, the romance and doomed love affair would also appeal to the female readership the &lt;em&gt;New-York Weekly&lt;/em&gt; aimed to serve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1. 2 November 1805]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Cruel Father&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE love of money is a passion which not on-&lt;br /&gt;
ly degrades our nature, and renders it insensible&lt;br /&gt;
to those ties which unite the human race, but&lt;br /&gt;
has the power of contracting all the softer affect-&lt;br /&gt;
tions, and of converting the heart of its posses-&lt;br /&gt;
sor into an impenetrable mass. Such a heart&lt;br /&gt;
was placed in the bosom of Malvolio; the plea-&lt;br /&gt;
dings of humanity never drew a tear from his&lt;br /&gt;
eyes; every feeling seemed bound up in an ad-&lt;br /&gt;
amantine girdle, which the hand of Plutus alone&lt;br /&gt;
had the power to unbrace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Malvolio had been educated under the care&lt;br /&gt;
of an uncle, who, by a train of petty meannesses,&lt;br /&gt;
had acquired a large portion of wealth; and the&lt;br /&gt;
artificial character of Biggs, or the real one of&lt;br /&gt;
Elwes, could not have devised the means of sa-&lt;br /&gt;
ving sixpence upon a more despicable plan.–&lt;br /&gt;
Taught from his infancy the intrinsic value of a&lt;br /&gt;
farthing, and instructed in the art of conver-&lt;br /&gt;
ting pence into pounds, money, in fact, became&lt;br /&gt;
his idol; and to obtain it, he frequently over-&lt;br /&gt;
stepped honesty’s bounds. The uncle of Mal-&lt;br /&gt;
volio was one of those deceptious characters who&lt;br /&gt;
pass for men of rectitude in the opinion of the&lt;br /&gt;
world; he talked loudly of the increasing depra-&lt;br /&gt;
vity of human nature, subscribed to public char-&lt;br /&gt;
ities, and went regularly to church. Under&lt;br /&gt;
this appearance of virtue and sanctity, a fraudu-&lt;br /&gt;
lent and selfish disposition was concealed; and&lt;br /&gt;
a merchant, with whom he lived in the habits&lt;br /&gt;
of the greatest intimacy, committed into his care&lt;br /&gt;
the person and fortune of a beloved child.&lt;br /&gt;
This sacred deposit was no sooner placed in his&lt;br /&gt;
protection, than he determined she should be-&lt;br /&gt;
come his nephew’s wife, and Malvolio, delight-&lt;br /&gt;
ed at the idea of becoming master of a large for-&lt;br /&gt;
tune, was highly gratified at his relation’s choice.&lt;br /&gt;
The inclinations of the young lady were&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; not e-&lt;br /&gt;
ven consulted; and though her heart was pre-&lt;br /&gt;
engaged, her disposition was not formed to re-&lt;br /&gt;
bel; and though the gentle Isabella ventured to&lt;br /&gt;
remonstrate against her destiny, she found it of&lt;br /&gt;
no avail, and at length was forced to submit.&lt;br /&gt;
Never were dispositions more completely op-&lt;br /&gt;
posite than that of Malvolio and this amiable&lt;br /&gt;
girl: she was all sweetness, softness, and liber-&lt;br /&gt;
ality; whilst his every emotion was absorbed in&lt;br /&gt;
the desire of accumulating wealth. In addition&lt;br /&gt;
to this, he was a domestic tyrant; his passions&lt;br /&gt;
were violent, and he was the victim of caprice:&lt;br /&gt;
at one moment he would caress her with a fond-&lt;br /&gt;
ness absolutely fulsome, and at the next he&lt;br /&gt;
would almost annihilate her with rage. About&lt;br /&gt;
two years after her marriage, Isabella became a&lt;br /&gt;
mother. A variety of pleasing emotions crow-&lt;br /&gt;
ded upon her mind; but the child at once pro-&lt;br /&gt;
ved a source of comfort and uneasiness; for Mal-&lt;br /&gt;
volio insisted upon superintending the care of it&lt;br /&gt;
himself. If she ordered the servant to walk out&lt;br /&gt;
with it, that was improper; if it was retained&lt;br /&gt;
in the nursery, she was ruining its health; and,&lt;br /&gt;
under the pretence of fondness for the infant,&lt;br /&gt;
its unfortunate mother had not a moment’s&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; peace.&lt;br /&gt;
The little Adolphus, however, grew in spite&lt;br /&gt;
of the inconsistencies of the capricious author of&lt;br /&gt;
his birth, and displayed, even in childhood, a&lt;br /&gt;
variety of instances of a good understanding,&lt;br /&gt;
and a susceptible heart. To strengthen those&lt;br /&gt;
amiable propensities, which he had derived&lt;br /&gt;
from nature, afforded Isabella, the highest de-&lt;br /&gt;
light; and, in the absence of his father, all her&lt;br /&gt;
attention was devoted to the controlling&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; his pas-&lt;br /&gt;
sions, and the cultivation of his mind. In the&lt;br /&gt;
twelfth year of his age, Adolphus had the mis-&lt;br /&gt;
fortune to lose a mother, whom he at once loved&lt;br /&gt;
and revered: but though death had deprived&lt;br /&gt;
him of her maternal tenderness, her precepts&lt;br /&gt;
had made a strong impression upon his heart.&lt;br /&gt;
Though Isabella appeared to have no influ-&lt;br /&gt;
ence upon Malvolio’s conduct, yet, by her sooth-&lt;br /&gt;
ing softness, his passions were frequent-&lt;br /&gt;
ly allayed; and when deprived of her, he gave&lt;br /&gt;
them an unbounded dominion over him, to the&lt;br /&gt;
terror of those who were under his power. A-&lt;br /&gt;
dolphus not only inherited the amiable dispos-&lt;br /&gt;
tion of his mother, but possessed all that yield-&lt;br /&gt;
ing softness for which she was admired, and ne-&lt;br /&gt;
ver presumed to oppose the commands of Malvo-&lt;br /&gt;
lio, though they were frequently repugnant to&lt;br /&gt;
every feeling of his heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The time, however, at length arrived, when&lt;br /&gt;
duty and affection were at warfare; for Malvo-&lt;br /&gt;
lio thought himself entitled to provide a&lt;br /&gt;
wife for his son; and as fortune had been his only&lt;br /&gt;
consideration, he expected Adolphus to adopt&lt;br /&gt;
the same plan. The disposition of this young&lt;br /&gt;
man was formed for domestic happiness, and he&lt;br /&gt;
had beheld and object with whom he thought it&lt;br /&gt;
was to be found; she was the daughter of an&lt;br /&gt;
officer, who had no fortune but his commission,&lt;br /&gt;
who lived within a short distance of his father’s&lt;br /&gt;
house. The mind of Eliza Desborough had&lt;br /&gt;
been highly cultivated; her form was the most&lt;br /&gt;
perfect that can possibly be conceived; her&lt;br /&gt;
countenance was at once an index to her feel-&lt;br /&gt;
ings, and expressed her sensations without the&lt;br /&gt;
language of speech. Such was the amiable girl&lt;br /&gt;
who had made an impression upon the heart of&lt;br /&gt;
Adolphus, which it was beyond the power of&lt;br /&gt;
parental authority to efface; and the wife which&lt;br /&gt;
his father had selected, was in every respect op-&lt;br /&gt;
posite to her; for she was destitute of every per-&lt;br /&gt;
sonal and every mental grace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Adolphus,” said his father to him one mor-&lt;br /&gt;
ning at breakfast, “I intend introducing you&lt;br /&gt;
this evening to the rich heiress, Miss Green.&lt;br /&gt;
She has twenty thousand pounds independent&lt;br /&gt;
of her father, who I know has above double that&lt;br /&gt;
sum snug in the stocks; and if you do but play&lt;br /&gt;
your cards with caution, the prize will be yours,&lt;br /&gt;
I’d bet a thousand pounds!” Adolphus was so&lt;br /&gt;
petrified with this piece of intelligence, that he&lt;br /&gt;
was absolutely unable to make any reply: when&lt;br /&gt;
his father exclaimed, in a voice of authority,&lt;br /&gt;
“Pray, Sir, have you lost the use of your&lt;br /&gt;
tongue?” “No, Sir,” replied Adolphus; ‘‘but&lt;br /&gt;
I have never thought of marriage. And–I–I&lt;br /&gt;
–I cannot say I am much struck with the per-&lt;br /&gt;
son of Miss Green.’’ “Struck,’’ said Malvolio,&lt;br /&gt;
in a tone of violence: “But, Sir, have you ne-&lt;br /&gt;
ver heard of a father striking a son out of his&lt;br /&gt;
will? Yet&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; I tell you once for all, boy, I am deter-&lt;br /&gt;
mined you shall marry her; for I shall not be&lt;br /&gt;
such a fool as to let you choose for yourself.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Sir,” rejoined Adolphus, inspired by the&lt;br /&gt;
recollection of Eliza Desborough’s attractions,&lt;br /&gt;
“I have in all things paid an implicit obedience&lt;br /&gt;
to your wishes; but you cannot desire me to&lt;br /&gt;
sacrifice the happiness of my life; and I must&lt;br /&gt;
candidly declare that I have a repugnance to&lt;br /&gt;
the idea of even thinking of Miss Green in the&lt;br /&gt;
character of a wife.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“And have you any repugnance to her for-&lt;br /&gt;
tune, Sir?” thundered out Malvolio scarcely a-&lt;br /&gt;
ble to articulate from the violence of his rage.&lt;br /&gt;
You numbskull&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;! you blockhead! How&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; dare you&lt;br /&gt;
dispute my orders! Why, I tell you, the girl&lt;br /&gt;
will have sixty thousand pounds; and I tell you,&lt;br /&gt;
moreover, that I will make a beggar of you, un-&lt;br /&gt;
less you marry the person of whom I make&lt;br /&gt;
choice.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was in vain for Adolphus to attempt dispu-&lt;br /&gt;
ting with his father in this violent perturbation&lt;br /&gt;
of fury and rage; he therefore endeavoured to&lt;br /&gt;
allay the paroxysm of his passion, by declaring&lt;br /&gt;
himself ready to accompany him to Miss Green’s.&lt;br /&gt;
Conformable as he had hitherto been to the&lt;br /&gt;
wishes of his father, in this instance he resolute-&lt;br /&gt;
ly determined not to yield; and though he a-&lt;br /&gt;
greed to pay the intended visit, the image of E-&lt;br /&gt;
liza reigned triumphant in his heart. If the&lt;br /&gt;
person of Miss Green had excited disgustful e-&lt;br /&gt;
motions, how much were they increased by the&lt;br /&gt;
vulgar coarseness of her remarks! He was con-&lt;br /&gt;
vinced that their marriage had been a precon-&lt;br /&gt;
certed measure by their parents; for the mo-&lt;br /&gt;
ment tea was ended they were left by them-&lt;br /&gt;
selves. Instead of the young lady displaying&lt;br /&gt;
any embarrassment at this circumstance, she had&lt;br /&gt;
the indelicacy to turn it into jest; enquired&lt;br /&gt;
whether it was the first time he had ever been&lt;br /&gt;
left tète a téte with a female; and asked if the&lt;br /&gt;
novelty of the circumstance excited any new&lt;br /&gt;
sensation in his breast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was with the utmost difficulty that Adol-&lt;br /&gt;
phus could so far conquer his feelings, as to par-&lt;br /&gt;
ry off her questions, as if she had merely been&lt;br /&gt;
in jest, but never did he think the hours pas-&lt;br /&gt;
sed so tediously as until Mr. Green, and his fa-&lt;br /&gt;
ther returned. The smirking countenance of&lt;br /&gt;
the lady delighted Malvolio, who flattered him-&lt;br /&gt;
self that his son had been intimidated by his&lt;br /&gt;
threats, and had thought sixty thousand pounds&lt;br /&gt;
an ample compensation for every bodily and&lt;br /&gt;
mental defect. Full of this idea, he took leave&lt;br /&gt;
of the father and daughter, having some mercantile&lt;br /&gt;
affairs to transact with a gentleman in his own&lt;br /&gt;
line; and Adolphus pleading a violent head-&lt;br /&gt;
ache, Malvolio did not persuade him to stay.&lt;br /&gt;
Released from that restriction he had been&lt;br /&gt;
compelled to put upon his feelings, the footsteps&lt;br /&gt;
of Adolphus involuntarily led towards Captain&lt;br /&gt;
Desborough’s house, when the sight of the muf-&lt;br /&gt;
fled knocker gave a horror to his feelings, and&lt;br /&gt;
for a few moments suspended the pulsation of&lt;br /&gt;
his heart. He rang softly at the bell, yet dread-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to see the door opened, lest he should hear&lt;br /&gt;
some fatal intelligence respecting the object so&lt;br /&gt;
dear to his heart; and when the servant appear-&lt;br /&gt;
ed, he could scarcely enquire, whether it was&lt;br /&gt;
Captain or Miss Desborough who was ill.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh! ‘tis my poor master, Sir,” replied the&lt;br /&gt;
woman, taking up the corner of her apron to&lt;br /&gt;
wipe away the tears which her news had exci-&lt;br /&gt;
ted; “but, my dear young lady, I assure you,&lt;br /&gt;
is in a dreadful condition; for the doctor has&lt;br /&gt;
just told her the capt. cannot live!” “Not live!”&lt;br /&gt;
exclaimed Adolphus, turning pale at the infor-&lt;br /&gt;
mation–“Oh, God! What&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; a stroke for my poor&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza to endure!” Not sensible of what he said,&lt;br /&gt;
he then asked the servant if she thought her mast-&lt;br /&gt;
er could be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Adolphus from a child had visited at&lt;br /&gt;
Captain Desborough’s, and was treated by him&lt;br /&gt;
with the same familiar affection as if he had been&lt;br /&gt;
his son, he had never even ventured to mention&lt;br /&gt;
his passion to him, though in a thousand differ-&lt;br /&gt;
ent instances he had displayed the feelings of&lt;br /&gt;
his heart. Shocked, as he was, at the idea of&lt;br /&gt;
his friend’s situation, he was still more so at&lt;br /&gt;
the prospect of Eliza’s unprotected state; and&lt;br /&gt;
he was anxious to obtain the sanction of Captain&lt;br /&gt;
Desborough, to shield her from the dangers to&lt;br /&gt;
which youth and beauty is exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The servant, who knew the intimate footing&lt;br /&gt;
which Adolphus was received in the family, in-&lt;br /&gt;
stantly conducted him into her master’s room;&lt;br /&gt;
and though the exhausted invalid had appeared&lt;br /&gt;
to be dying, he instantly rose from his pillow,&lt;br /&gt;
exclaimed, “Oh, my son!” Adolphus seized&lt;br /&gt;
the hand which had been extended towards him,&lt;br /&gt;
and involuntarily dropped upon his knees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(TO BE CONTINUED)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2. 9 November 1805]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Continued.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Commit Eliza to my care,” said he: “I&lt;br /&gt;
will be her protector. But let me not deceive&lt;br /&gt;
you in a moment like this! My&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; father, dearest&lt;br /&gt;
sir, will never consent to our union. In the&lt;br /&gt;
wish of promoting my interest, he would sacri-&lt;br /&gt;
fice my peace; and he has positively declared,&lt;br /&gt;
that he will make me a beggar, unless I consent&lt;br /&gt;
to marry Miss Green. My heart, long attach-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to your amiable Eliza, asserts the privilege of&lt;br /&gt;
making its choice; industry and exertion will&lt;br /&gt;
render me independent; and to-morow mor-&lt;br /&gt;
ning, with your permission, I will make her my&lt;br /&gt;
wife. The affection which I have long felt to-&lt;br /&gt;
wards her, has been of so refined a nature, that&lt;br /&gt;
I dreaded asking your consent, from the fear of&lt;br /&gt;
being refused; and not anything&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; would have&lt;br /&gt;
induced me to make this declaration, but the a-&lt;br /&gt;
larming state to which I see you reduced!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If there is any other being to whose protection&lt;br /&gt;
you can intrust her, whose fortunes appear more&lt;br /&gt;
brilliant than my own—-“No, No,” exclaim-&lt;br /&gt;
med the dying man interrupting him, “She&lt;br /&gt;
would prefer poverty with you, I am persuaded,&lt;br /&gt;
my son.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this conversation, the agitated Eliza&lt;br /&gt;
sat in a state of stupefied&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; sorrow on the other&lt;br /&gt;
side of the bed, until roused by Adolphus enqui-&lt;br /&gt;
ring, in a faltering accent, whether she would&lt;br /&gt;
consent to bless him with her hand, “In a mo-&lt;br /&gt;
ment like this,” said the weeping object of his&lt;br /&gt;
affection, “how can I indulge one thought a-&lt;br /&gt;
bout myself?” It is only in such a moment,&lt;br /&gt;
my beloved Eliza,” replied Adolphus, “that I&lt;br /&gt;
could have ventured to ask you to bless me with&lt;br /&gt;
your consent. If Heaven should deprive you&lt;br /&gt;
of the protection of your father, it is only under&lt;br /&gt;
the title of your husband, that I can prove my-&lt;br /&gt;
self your friend!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Give him your hand, my Eliza,” said the&lt;br /&gt;
exhausted Captain Desborough, “for I have&lt;br /&gt;
long known that he has had the possession of&lt;br /&gt;
your heart. And may the blessing of a dying&lt;br /&gt;
man shield you from misfortunes! and oh, Adol-&lt;br /&gt;
phus! Be&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; tender, be affectionate to my child!”&lt;br /&gt;
The entrance of the apothecary with a large&lt;br /&gt;
blister, which he was going to apply to his pa-&lt;br /&gt;
tient’s head, put an end to a conversation, which&lt;br /&gt;
was becoming too interesting for the enfeebled&lt;br /&gt;
frame of Captain Desborough to sustain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The variety of emotions which agitated Adol-&lt;br /&gt;
phus, it would be difficult for the power of lan-&lt;br /&gt;
guage to describe. He knew he was going to&lt;br /&gt;
forfeit all claims upon his father, by making the&lt;br /&gt;
amiable Eliza his wife. Whether to inform&lt;br /&gt;
him of his intention, or whether to marry with-&lt;br /&gt;
out endeavouring to soften his rage, was a cir-&lt;br /&gt;
cumstance which required mature reflection;&lt;br /&gt;
yet no time could possibly be allowed for delay.&lt;br /&gt;
A relation of his mother’s was the only person&lt;br /&gt;
to whom he could apply for council and advice;&lt;br /&gt;
he accordingly took leave of the object of his&lt;br /&gt;
tenderness for the purpose of consulting this&lt;br /&gt;
friend. The illness of Captain Desborough had&lt;br /&gt;
been so extremely sudden, that though this gen-&lt;br /&gt;
tleman was intimately acquainted with him, he&lt;br /&gt;
was a stranger to the event; and when he re-&lt;br /&gt;
flected upon the irreconcileable temper of Mal-&lt;br /&gt;
volio, he was at a loss to know how to advise his&lt;br /&gt;
agitated son. The mutual attachment between&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza and Adolphus, Mr. Middleton had for a&lt;br /&gt;
length of time observed; and had cautioned&lt;br /&gt;
him against going so frequently to Captain Des-&lt;br /&gt;
borough’s knowing that his father would never&lt;br /&gt;
consent to the match; but when he heard that&lt;br /&gt;
Adolphus had made an absolute declaration of&lt;br /&gt;
his passion, and that a dying parent had com-&lt;br /&gt;
mitted a darling child to his care, he thought a&lt;br /&gt;
private marriage would be the most adviseable&lt;br /&gt;
measure, and undertook the kind office of mak-&lt;br /&gt;
ing Malvolio acquainted with the event. He&lt;br /&gt;
accordingly accompanied Adolphus to the house&lt;br /&gt;
of a neighbouring clergyman; the license was&lt;br /&gt;
procured, and the next morning he attended&lt;br /&gt;
him to church, where the ceremony was per-&lt;br /&gt;
formed without any witnesses, except Mr. Middle-&lt;br /&gt;
ton and the clerk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was with the utmost difficulty that Eliza&lt;br /&gt;
could be persuaded to leave her father, who see-&lt;br /&gt;
med to revive at the thought of leaving her un-&lt;br /&gt;
der Adolphus’s care; and whose spirit waited&lt;br /&gt;
to take its flight to the mansions of eternity un-&lt;br /&gt;
til the arrival of Mr. Middleton, who had wit-&lt;br /&gt;
nessed the event. The variety of conflicting e-&lt;br /&gt;
motions which had torn the breast of Eliza, pro-&lt;br /&gt;
duced an alarming effect upon her delicate&lt;br /&gt;
frame; and the moment she entered the house&lt;br /&gt;
of her father, she dropped apparently lifeless in-&lt;br /&gt;
to her husband’s arms. By the help of volatiles,&lt;br /&gt;
she was restored to recollection; but as it was&lt;br /&gt;
necessary to conceal the circumstance from the&lt;br /&gt;
dying man, Mr. Middleton hastened to the a-&lt;br /&gt;
partment, to inform him that he had seen the&lt;br /&gt;
ceremony performed. Scarcely had this intel-&lt;br /&gt;
ligence been imparted, when clasping his hands&lt;br /&gt;
with fervor and delight he exclaimed, ‘’ I thank&lt;br /&gt;
thee, oh my God, for lengthening my existence&lt;br /&gt;
until this gratifying intelligence had afforded&lt;br /&gt;
comfort to my mind! Bless them, oh thou mer-&lt;br /&gt;
ciful Protector of the friendless. Oh, bless, de-&lt;br /&gt;
fend, and sustain my child!” Here his lips&lt;br /&gt;
quivered, his voice faltered, and raising his eyes&lt;br /&gt;
to Heaven, he instantly expired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scene which followed, language can&lt;br /&gt;
scarcely depicture, for at that instant Eliza o-&lt;br /&gt;
pened the door, when the lifeless form of her fa-&lt;br /&gt;
ther presented itself to her; and before Mr. Middle-&lt;br /&gt;
ton could prevent the effort, she had encircled it&lt;br /&gt;
in her arms! Horror for some moments check-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the power of utterance; the assuaging balm&lt;br /&gt;
of tears was denied, and grasping the body&lt;br /&gt;
with a force that refused yielding to exertion,&lt;br /&gt;
she seemed determined not to move from its&lt;br /&gt;
side! The groans of Adolphus, who thought&lt;br /&gt;
her intellects were effected, at length seemed to&lt;br /&gt;
restore recollection to her mind; and stretching&lt;br /&gt;
out one hand towards him, she uttered a shrill,&lt;br /&gt;
piercing scream! This effort of nature fortu-&lt;br /&gt;
nately relieved her; and she soon afterwards&lt;br /&gt;
burst into a violent flood of grief, consented to&lt;br /&gt;
be removed from the object of her affection, and,&lt;br /&gt;
though overwhelmed with affliction, was per-&lt;br /&gt;
fectly resigned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adolphus was under the cruel necessity of tear-&lt;br /&gt;
ing himself from his beloved Eliza, and of atten-&lt;br /&gt;
ding as usual to mercantile affairs: but to the&lt;br /&gt;
bosom of a female friend their secret was intrus-&lt;br /&gt;
ted, who, upon the death of Captain Desborough&lt;br /&gt;
remained at the house. Malvolio was too much&lt;br /&gt;
occupied in the concerns of business, to pay a-&lt;br /&gt;
ny attention to the dejection so visible in his&lt;br /&gt;
son; but when dinner was over, he again ex-&lt;br /&gt;
plained the advantages which would result from&lt;br /&gt;
his forming a union with Miss Green. Fortu-&lt;br /&gt;
nately for Adolphus, Mr. Middleton at that mo-&lt;br /&gt;
ment entered. “I am glad to see you,” exclai-&lt;br /&gt;
med Malvolio with a smile. “I have a scheme&lt;br /&gt;
in agitation, which does not seem quite to accord&lt;br /&gt;
with the wishes of that blockhead: in short I&lt;br /&gt;
am going to provide him with a wife.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I should suppose he would prefer providing&lt;br /&gt;
himself with a commodity of that nature,” said&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Middleton; “however he may wish to&lt;br /&gt;
consult you in any affair of trade.” What&lt;br /&gt;
the devil do you mean?” exclaimed Malvolio:&lt;br /&gt;
“would you teach disobedience to that head-&lt;br /&gt;
strong boy?” “Far from it,” replied the mild&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Middleton; “but I think there is no possi-&lt;br /&gt;
bility of directing the wayward feelings of the&lt;br /&gt;
heart.” “That is very true,” said the hitherto&lt;br /&gt;
silent Adolphus:–“And in every thing but&lt;br /&gt;
marriage, I am ready to obey my father’s com-&lt;br /&gt;
mands.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“You shall obey them in that too, Sir, or&lt;br /&gt;
from this moment I renounce you for ever,”&lt;br /&gt;
said Malvolio, in a voice suffocated with rage.&lt;br /&gt;
“But get out of my sight, and never let me be-&lt;br /&gt;
hold you, unless you feel ready to let my or-&lt;br /&gt;
ders be obeyed!” Adolphus instantly rose&lt;br /&gt;
from the table, and flew to the object who occu-&lt;br /&gt;
pied his every thought, but carefully concealed&lt;br /&gt;
the preceeding conversation, fearful of adding to&lt;br /&gt;
the sorrow which already preyed upon her&lt;br /&gt;
heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as he had quitted the room, Malvolio&lt;br /&gt;
informed Mr. Middleton that a marriage be-&lt;br /&gt;
tween the young people had been proposed by&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Green; “and because the girl is not hand-&lt;br /&gt;
some,” said he, “would you believe it possible,&lt;br /&gt;
that her fortune possesses no charms in his eyes!&lt;br /&gt;
She has twenty thousand pounds independant of&lt;br /&gt;
her father; and Green has upwards of forty now&lt;br /&gt;
in the stocks; yet this rebel of mine would re-&lt;br /&gt;
ject such an aliance, when the girl has a right&lt;br /&gt;
to look up to a lord!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Perhaps his affections are engaged,” replied&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Middleton; and in that case it would be&lt;br /&gt;
villainous to offer himself for her husband.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Zounds, sir!” exclaimed he, “do you think&lt;br /&gt;
he dare do such a thing? What! Dispose&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; of his&lt;br /&gt;
affections without my consent!” “Come, come&lt;br /&gt;
my good friend, moderate your resentment;&lt;br /&gt;
and converse upon this subject like a rational&lt;br /&gt;
man. You have lived long enough in the world&lt;br /&gt;
to know that young people, in an affair like&lt;br /&gt;
that of marriage, will choose&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; for themselves.”–&lt;br /&gt;
“Will they?” vociferated the still more violent&lt;br /&gt;
Malvolio; “then I tell you that my son shall&lt;br /&gt;
not, by G–: and unless he chooses&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; to marry&lt;br /&gt;
the girl I select for him, the devil of one penny&lt;br /&gt;
shall he ever have from me.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But suppose it is out of his power to obey&lt;br /&gt;
you: suppose for one moment he is already a&lt;br /&gt;
married man.” “Then” exclaimed he, stri-&lt;br /&gt;
king the table with the utmost violence, “May&lt;br /&gt;
the curses of a father fall upon his head! –&lt;br /&gt;
may distress pursue–may poverty overtake him–&lt;br /&gt;
may his children become beggars–may his wife&lt;br /&gt;
perish in the streets–may sorrow and repent-&lt;br /&gt;
ance prey upon his vitals, until they destroy the&lt;br /&gt;
thread of his miserable life!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh shame to humanity, disgrace to the name&lt;br /&gt;
of father!” said the petrified Mr. Middleton, rising&lt;br /&gt;
from his seat; “fall upon the knees, implore&lt;br /&gt;
the pardon of that Being who in one instant can&lt;br /&gt;
put a period to your life! Have you not from&lt;br /&gt;
childhood been the favorite of heaven? Have&lt;br /&gt;
you not been blest in a wife, and happy in a&lt;br /&gt;
son? Has not fortune smiled upon all your un-&lt;br /&gt;
dertakings, yet you impiously offend Him from&lt;br /&gt;
whom these blessing are derived? Are you so&lt;br /&gt;
dead to feeling, so lost to the voice of nature, as&lt;br /&gt;
to call down curses upon the head of your child?&lt;br /&gt;
A child too, who excepting this one instance,&lt;br /&gt;
has made your wishes the absolute rule of his life.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(TO BE CONTINUED)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3. 16 November 1805]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Continued&lt;/em&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is he married?” enquired the pale and&lt;br /&gt;
trembling Malvolio. “What will you say, if I&lt;br /&gt;
tell you that he is?” “Say!” exclaimed he,&lt;br /&gt;
scarcely able to articulate the sentence, “That&lt;br /&gt;
I hope every curse will be multiplied upon his&lt;br /&gt;
head! And as to you, base and insidious vil-&lt;br /&gt;
lain, who have instilled principle of disobedi-&lt;br /&gt;
ence into the breast of my son, may you live to&lt;br /&gt;
feel disappointment like that which at present&lt;br /&gt;
overwhelms me; and may accumulated misfor-&lt;br /&gt;
tunes overcloud your days!” So saying, he&lt;br /&gt;
quitted the apartment, and gave orders that&lt;br /&gt;
his son should be denied admission into the&lt;br /&gt;
house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adolphus, who was ignorant of what had&lt;br /&gt;
passed between Mr. Middleton and his father,&lt;br /&gt;
returned to his paternal dwelling at the accus-&lt;br /&gt;
tomed hour, for the purpose of placing the keys&lt;br /&gt;
of the compting house in Malvolio’s room, which&lt;br /&gt;
was his usual practice. Upon rapping at the&lt;br /&gt;
door, it was opened by a servant, who had liv-&lt;br /&gt;
ed in the family of his mother, from the time&lt;br /&gt;
of her being a child, and whom she had enga-&lt;br /&gt;
ged in the capacity of a footman when she was&lt;br /&gt;
so unfortunate as to become a wife. Adolphus&lt;br /&gt;
was in the act of entering, when Stephen placed&lt;br /&gt;
himself before him with extended arms. “My&lt;br /&gt;
dear young master, (said he, in faultering ac-&lt;br /&gt;
cents) for God’s sake take the council of an old&lt;br /&gt;
man. Your father is enraged against you–&lt;br /&gt;
therefore do not attempt seeing him until his an-&lt;br /&gt;
ger subsides. Give me the keys of the compt-&lt;br /&gt;
ing house, and tell me where I can call upon&lt;br /&gt;
you to-morrow morning.” The poor fellow ut-&lt;br /&gt;
tered this speech with so much agitation, that&lt;br /&gt;
Adolphus was aware some terrible fracas had&lt;br /&gt;
occurred; and taking the keys out of his pock-&lt;br /&gt;
et, he was preparing to leave his father’s man-&lt;br /&gt;
sion, when Stephen thrust a purse into his&lt;br /&gt;
hand, and burst into a flood of tears. “I dare&lt;br /&gt;
not offend you, sir, (said he) by begging your&lt;br /&gt;
acceptance of that trifle; but for God’s sake,&lt;br /&gt;
keep it only for me just a little time. I do not&lt;br /&gt;
know in whose hands to place it; and mayhap,&lt;br /&gt;
trifle as it is, it may be of some use to you. Oh,&lt;br /&gt;
my poor dear, dear mistress! What&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; a blessing it&lt;br /&gt;
is that she is not alive!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Excellent fellow! (exclaimed Adolphus–&lt;br /&gt;
catching the infection that streamed from his&lt;br /&gt;
aged eyes,) I value this proof of your friendship&lt;br /&gt;
and attachment more than it is in the power of&lt;br /&gt;
language to describe; but I am not distressed&lt;br /&gt;
for a few guineas; if I was, most gratefully&lt;br /&gt;
would I accept this boon.” As Adolphus had&lt;br /&gt;
promised to return again to Eliza, he determin-&lt;br /&gt;
ed not to acquaint her with what he had heard:&lt;br /&gt;
but the next morning he received a visit from&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Middleton, who thought it necessary to ac-&lt;br /&gt;
quaint him with all that had passed. Poverty&lt;br /&gt;
he could have borne; distress he could individ-&lt;br /&gt;
ually have encountered; but when he reflected&lt;br /&gt;
on the distress which the object of his tender-&lt;br /&gt;
ness must sustain, fortitude yielded to the pow-&lt;br /&gt;
er of affection, and the feelings of the man were&lt;br /&gt;
converted into those of the child. Roused into&lt;br /&gt;
energy by the arguments of Mr. Middleton, he&lt;br /&gt;
determined to write a conciliatory epistle to the&lt;br /&gt;
author of his birth; and if this did not succeed,&lt;br /&gt;
to endeavour to obtain employment in some of the&lt;br /&gt;
families with whom his father did business, as a&lt;br /&gt;
clerk. The letter, which was couched in terms&lt;br /&gt;
to have softened an heart of adamant, was read&lt;br /&gt;
without receiving any reply; and the inhuman&lt;br /&gt;
Malvolio circulated amongst his acquaintance,&lt;br /&gt;
the most cruel and unjust aspersions against his&lt;br /&gt;
son; and actually declared that he had embez-&lt;br /&gt;
zled the property which had been committed to&lt;br /&gt;
his trust.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The consequence of these reports was what&lt;br /&gt;
Malvolio expected; for no one would afford the&lt;br /&gt;
object of his resentment employ. His society&lt;br /&gt;
was shunned, and he was regarded as a monster&lt;br /&gt;
who deserved to be driven from the haunts of&lt;br /&gt;
mankind. In vain did the worthy Mr. Middle-&lt;br /&gt;
ton endeavor to vindicate his character; no one&lt;br /&gt;
believed it possible for a parent unjustly to con-&lt;br /&gt;
demn his child; and those fathers who were&lt;br /&gt;
anxious to impress the practice of filial obedi-&lt;br /&gt;
ence, forbid their children from associating&lt;br /&gt;
with such a pupil of vice. Those manners&lt;br /&gt;
which had been admired for gentleness and&lt;br /&gt;
flexibility, were now said to have been the result&lt;br /&gt;
of policy and deceit; and his very virtues were&lt;br /&gt;
converted into vices:–so strong is the effect&lt;br /&gt;
which prejudice produces in the mind.&lt;br /&gt;
After having unsuccessfully endeavored to&lt;br /&gt;
obtain employment in England, from the desire&lt;br /&gt;
of not being separated from the wife he adored.&lt;br /&gt;
Adolphus at length obtained one in the West&lt;br /&gt;
Indies, through the interest of that friend who&lt;br /&gt;
was well acquainted with his worth. With a&lt;br /&gt;
heart torn by a variety of afflicting emotions, he&lt;br /&gt;
took leave of Eliza and her lovely little boy,&lt;br /&gt;
promising to send for them as soon as he was es-&lt;br /&gt;
tablished, if the situation proved equal to what&lt;br /&gt;
he had a right to expect. The anxieties he had&lt;br /&gt;
encountered and the distress he had been invol-&lt;br /&gt;
ved in not only depressed his spirits but debi-&lt;br /&gt;
litated his frame; and scarcely had he taken&lt;br /&gt;
possession of his new employment, when he was&lt;br /&gt;
attacked by the fever incident to that clime.–&lt;br /&gt;
The art of medicine was in vain exerted to save&lt;br /&gt;
him; his constitution was too much weakened&lt;br /&gt;
to struggle against the disease; and the physi-&lt;br /&gt;
cians informed him that the only chance he had&lt;br /&gt;
of recovery, was to return immediately to his&lt;br /&gt;
native clime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unjust stigma which had been cast upon&lt;br /&gt;
the character of Adolphus, seemed to extend e-&lt;br /&gt;
ven to his amiable wife; and amongst the num-&lt;br /&gt;
ber of her father’s friends, only one seemed sen&lt;br /&gt;
sible of her merits, or paid the least attention&lt;br /&gt;
either to her or her child. The sale of her fa-&lt;br /&gt;
ther’s furniture had procured her a little ready&lt;br /&gt;
money, but the greater part of this had been&lt;br /&gt;
expended in procuring the necessary articles&lt;br /&gt;
for her husband’s new employ; and Eliza had&lt;br /&gt;
no means of supporting her existence, but by&lt;br /&gt;
procuring work form the shops. The greater&lt;br /&gt;
part of the day was spent in nursing of her&lt;br /&gt;
helpless infant; therefore evening was the only&lt;br /&gt;
time she was able to work; and seldom did this&lt;br /&gt;
amiable and industrious young woman retire to&lt;br /&gt;
her bed before two o’clock. The anxieties of&lt;br /&gt;
her mind, and the fatigues she encountered,&lt;br /&gt;
soon produced a visible effect upon her health,&lt;br /&gt;
and she was no longer able to make those exer-&lt;br /&gt;
tions which, were absolutely necessary for her&lt;br /&gt;
support. The only friend who sympathized in&lt;br /&gt;
her misfortunes, was from the confinement of&lt;br /&gt;
her own income, unable to render her essential&lt;br /&gt;
relief; and her situation must have been deplo-&lt;br /&gt;
rable, but for the worthy Mr. Middleton, who,&lt;br /&gt;
out of a little more than a hundred a year, al-&lt;br /&gt;
lowed her half a guinea a week. The anxiety&lt;br /&gt;
she felt as receiving no letters from Adolphus,&lt;br /&gt;
may be imagined, but cannot easily be describe-&lt;br /&gt;
ed; and her foreboding fears, too readily sug-&lt;br /&gt;
gested, that he had fallen a victim to the unheal-&lt;br /&gt;
thiness of the clime. Brooding one evening o-&lt;br /&gt;
ver these melancholy reflections, and weeping&lt;br /&gt;
over the babe whom she wished had never been&lt;br /&gt;
born, she was roused from the train of misera-&lt;br /&gt;
ble ideas by a violent knocking at the door.—-&lt;br /&gt;
Her name was loudly vociferated by the person&lt;br /&gt;
of whom she hired the apartment. Eliza’s agi-&lt;br /&gt;
tation was so violent, that she could not rise from&lt;br /&gt;
her seat and the sound of several footsteps on&lt;br /&gt;
the stairs increased her emotion, and a univer-&lt;br /&gt;
sal tremor overspread her frame. The door was&lt;br /&gt;
opened, and Adolphus entered, pale, trembling,&lt;br /&gt;
and supported between two men. “Merciful&lt;br /&gt;
God! (she exclaimed) do I behold my husband?&lt;br /&gt;
Oh, my Adolphus, I could have borne any thing&lt;br /&gt;
but this!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“My Eliza! (said he, extending his arms to-&lt;br /&gt;
wards her,) my loved, my adored, my unfortu-&lt;br /&gt;
nate wife! Oh, how you are changed? I want-&lt;br /&gt;
ed not this affliction to complete the miseries&lt;br /&gt;
and distresses of my life!” The humane com-&lt;br /&gt;
panions of the wretched Adolphus mixed their&lt;br /&gt;
tears with those of the ill-fated pair; and, after&lt;br /&gt;
assisting the debilitated Eliza to undress her ap-&lt;br /&gt;
parently dying husband kindly went to Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Middleton to inform him he was arrived. On&lt;br /&gt;
the wings of friendship, that worthy man flew to&lt;br /&gt;
the house of sorrow; but what an effecting scene&lt;br /&gt;
presented itself to his eyes! The expiring A-&lt;br /&gt;
dolphus was supported by pillows, and by&lt;br /&gt;
the side of him knelt his disconsolate wife “My&lt;br /&gt;
friend my only friend! (said he, in scarcely ar-&lt;br /&gt;
ticulate accents,) the Almighty in mercy has&lt;br /&gt;
granted my prayer. I wished but to breathe&lt;br /&gt;
out my soul in the arms of my Eliza; and to re-&lt;br /&gt;
commend her, and my boy to your care!”–&lt;br /&gt;
“Talk not of dying my dear honest fellow, (re-&lt;br /&gt;
plied the agitated Middleton;) I hope you will&lt;br /&gt;
live many, many years. You are fatigued with&lt;br /&gt;
your journey. I will run for a doctor;” and at&lt;br /&gt;
that moment he was hastening out of the room.&lt;br /&gt;
Stop! Stop! I conjure you, (exclaimed the&lt;br /&gt;
unfortunate sufferer, in a more renovated tone&lt;br /&gt;
of voice;) all assistance is vain. I feel myself&lt;br /&gt;
going to that bourne from whence no traveller&lt;br /&gt;
returns! My father! My&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; inexorable father!&lt;br /&gt;
will, perhaps, pardon my transgression, when&lt;br /&gt;
he knows I can no longer offend. Will you, my&lt;br /&gt;
friend, undertake to solicit his protection for my&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza, and her unfortunate child?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I will undertake every thing, (rejoined the&lt;br /&gt;
still more agitated Middleton,) if you will but&lt;br /&gt;
suffer me instantly to procure you advice. You&lt;br /&gt;
have youth on your side; much may be done&lt;br /&gt;
for you.” “Oh, fly, Mr. Middleton!” ex-&lt;br /&gt;
claimed the hitherto silent wife. The worthy&lt;br /&gt;
man did not require the request to be repeated,&lt;br /&gt;
and returned with a physician in less than a&lt;br /&gt;
quarter of an hour, who, the moment he felt the&lt;br /&gt;
pulse of his patient, knew he had only a short&lt;br /&gt;
time to live. The agonized Eliza watched his&lt;br /&gt;
countenance with an anxiety which it would be&lt;br /&gt;
difficult to describe, and too soon discovered the&lt;br /&gt;
hopeless state of her husband, in the melancho-&lt;br /&gt;
ly turn of his features, and the sympathizing&lt;br /&gt;
tenderness of his eyes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“We shall soon meet again, my Adolphus,&lt;br /&gt;
(said she, tenderly embracing him,) where pa-&lt;br /&gt;
rental authority cannot extend! I feel, my be-&lt;br /&gt;
loved, that our separation will be transient; yet&lt;br /&gt;
that unfortunate infant still endears me to life!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;To be continued in our next.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[4. 23 November 1805]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(&lt;em&gt;Concluded.&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Try to live for his sake, I implore you, my&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza,” exclaimed the affectionate Adolphus, re-&lt;br /&gt;
turning her embrace. Here his voice faltered&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;–&lt;br /&gt;
his breath became shorter, and, uttering&lt;br /&gt;
a penetrating groan, he expired! “Has he left&lt;br /&gt;
me? (exclaimed the frantic Eliza, grasping the&lt;br /&gt;
lifeless body in her arms) Oh, Adolphus! my&lt;br /&gt;
beloved; death shall not part us! No, never;–&lt;br /&gt;
never shall you leave me again!” The physi-&lt;br /&gt;
cian endeavored to disengage her arms from the&lt;br /&gt;
body; but she grasped it with a still firmer hold;&lt;br /&gt;
and uttering a violent scream, fell into convul-&lt;br /&gt;
sions, when with the utmost exertion of strength&lt;br /&gt;
she was removed. One fit rapidly succeeded&lt;br /&gt;
another, until at length nature seemed exhaust-&lt;br /&gt;
ed by fatigue, and the humane physician did&lt;br /&gt;
not leave her until she had fallen into a quiet&lt;br /&gt;
sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humane Mr. Middleton’s heart had ne-&lt;br /&gt;
ver encountered such a trial. He had always lo-&lt;br /&gt;
ved Adolphus, with as much affection as if he&lt;br /&gt;
had been his child. He had likewise known&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza from a state of infancy, and was well ac-&lt;br /&gt;
quainted with the exquisite sensibility of her&lt;br /&gt;
mind. Though the person with whom she&lt;br /&gt;
lodged was a very good kind of a woman, yet she&lt;br /&gt;
was a stranger to that soothing tenderness which&lt;br /&gt;
gratifies the heart; he determined, therefore,&lt;br /&gt;
to send the only person who had consoled E-&lt;br /&gt;
liza in affliction, and who seemed to be truly&lt;br /&gt;
sensible of her worth. Mrs. Herbert, which&lt;br /&gt;
was this lady’s name, instantly obeyed the sum-&lt;br /&gt;
mons; but what an effecting scene presented it-&lt;br /&gt;
self to her sight! In one room, she beheld the&lt;br /&gt;
dead body of Adolphus; and in another, his&lt;br /&gt;
apparently expiring wife; Eliza, it is true, was&lt;br /&gt;
sleeping; yet she breathed with the utmost&lt;br /&gt;
difficulty, and every feature in her beautiful&lt;br /&gt;
countenance had undergone a change: entirely&lt;br /&gt;
round, her mouth was disfigured with a black&lt;br /&gt;
circle, and frequent groans testified the uneasy&lt;br /&gt;
state of her mind. The little infant began to&lt;br /&gt;
be uneasy for that sustenance which it would&lt;br /&gt;
have been dangerous for him to have drawn:&lt;br /&gt;
but the mistress of the house, at the same peri-&lt;br /&gt;
od, fortunately happened to be a nurse. Eliza&lt;br /&gt;
continued in these uneasy slumbers for the space&lt;br /&gt;
of seven hours, when springing upright in her&lt;br /&gt;
bed, she terrified her attendants, by exclaim-&lt;br /&gt;
ing, “Oh, my Adolphus, I come–I come!”–&lt;br /&gt;
Again the fits returned upon her, and with far&lt;br /&gt;
greater violence than before, until nature was&lt;br /&gt;
exhausted by the violence of exertion–and the&lt;br /&gt;
hapless Eliza expired. Every effort that human&lt;br /&gt;
skill could suggest was made use of; but the&lt;br /&gt;
spotless spirit had taken its flight; the lifeless&lt;br /&gt;
body of Eliza was laid by that of her husband;&lt;br /&gt;
and kneeling by the side of them, Middleton&lt;br /&gt;
sacredly promised to become a father to their&lt;br /&gt;
child.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the day of Adolphus’ marriage, Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Middleton had never seen Malvolio; though he&lt;br /&gt;
had written several letters expressing the hor-&lt;br /&gt;
ror he felt at his unjust aspersions on the charac-&lt;br /&gt;
ter of his child: and he now meditated a revenge&lt;br /&gt;
which he thought must punish his depravity,&lt;br /&gt;
and penetrate into the deep recesses of his mind.&lt;br /&gt;
Scarcely had the idea entered his imagination,&lt;br /&gt;
when he directed his footsteps towards Malvo-&lt;br /&gt;
lio’s house, and rapping at the door, made no&lt;br /&gt;
inquiries, but walked unceremoniously into the&lt;br /&gt;
room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Is it you, Mr. Middleton? (exclaimed Mal-&lt;br /&gt;
volio) this is a pleasure which I did not expect&lt;br /&gt;
to receive, I am heartily glad to see you, how-&lt;br /&gt;
ever: but you will think it a great proof of my&lt;br /&gt;
want of sense, when I tell you I have been&lt;br /&gt;
dreadfully disturbed with dreams. In short, I&lt;br /&gt;
cannot help thinking it a vision; but I wish to&lt;br /&gt;
know whether you have lately heard any news&lt;br /&gt;
of my son?” “Your son arrived last night in&lt;br /&gt;
England, (replied Middleton, indignantly.)–&lt;br /&gt;
The climate, unfortunately, has proved destruct-&lt;br /&gt;
tive to his health; your cruelty had preyed too&lt;br /&gt;
deeply upon his constitution, and rendered him&lt;br /&gt;
unable to cope with disease.” “God forbid!–&lt;br /&gt;
(exclaimed the at length repented Malvolio.)&lt;br /&gt;
Then I fear that my dream will to soon be made&lt;br /&gt;
out. I will go and see him this instant, if you&lt;br /&gt;
will introduce me; but I have not the courage&lt;br /&gt;
to go alone.” “I am ready, (rejoined Middle-&lt;br /&gt;
ton,) for it is the very thing I came for; but you&lt;br /&gt;
must expect to see him considerably changed;&lt;br /&gt;
and his poor wife is equally altered, and both at&lt;br /&gt;
this moment are confined to their bed.” Mal-&lt;br /&gt;
volio sighed, but made no reply to this intelli-&lt;br /&gt;
gence; and a total silence ensued until they ar-&lt;br /&gt;
rived at the house; when, opening the door of&lt;br /&gt;
the apartment where the lifeless bodies lay ex-&lt;br /&gt;
tended, he exclaimed, “Behold the victims of&lt;br /&gt;
your cruelty, and tremble at the sight! Monster&lt;br /&gt;
of iniquity! (continued he, exalting his accents,)&lt;br /&gt;
disgrace to the very name you bear! What fa-&lt;br /&gt;
ther but yourself, would not have been proud&lt;br /&gt;
of studying the happiness of such an amiable,&lt;br /&gt;
such a deserving son? You have not only been&lt;br /&gt;
the destroyer of his existence, but you have&lt;br /&gt;
been the murderer of his fame: yet, if Provi-&lt;br /&gt;
dence grants me life, I will vindicate his mem-&lt;br /&gt;
ory, and disperse that vile odium you cast upon his&lt;br /&gt;
name!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Oh,God! Thy&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:18&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; judgments are fallen heavy&lt;br /&gt;
upon me! (said the petrified Malvolio, clinging&lt;br /&gt;
for support to the bed.) And is he really dead?&lt;br /&gt;
Call me not murderer! Oh! This&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; is a blow which&lt;br /&gt;
human nature cannot bear! Oh, Adolphus! In-&lt;br /&gt;
jured Adolphus! How&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:20&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; shall I expiate the enor-&lt;br /&gt;
mity of my crime?” “Thus, (said the worthy&lt;br /&gt;
Middleton, taking the infant from the cradle,)&lt;br /&gt;
become a parent to this unprotected child. Not&lt;br /&gt;
that I will ever resign him to your protection;&lt;br /&gt;
no–his happiness shall be the first object of my&lt;br /&gt;
life. I have sworn to protect him over the bo-&lt;br /&gt;
dies of his parents, and most religiously will I&lt;br /&gt;
fulfil my vow. Make him your heir; that is&lt;br /&gt;
all I require from you; it is the only compensa-&lt;br /&gt;
tion you can make him for the loss of your son.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Alas! Exclaimed&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:21&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:21&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; Malvolio, my happiness&lt;br /&gt;
is fled forever, and I no longer wish for the con-&lt;br /&gt;
tinuance of life: yet surely I am not the wretch&lt;br /&gt;
that you describe me! Surely I have not been&lt;br /&gt;
the murderer of my child! Oh, Middleton! Why&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:22&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:22&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
did you not let me see him before those lips were&lt;br /&gt;
finally closed? Perhaps he would have told me&lt;br /&gt;
he pardoned my cruelty; and, from possessing&lt;br /&gt;
his forgiveness, I might have died in peace!–&lt;br /&gt;
(Then throwing himself upon the bed by the&lt;br /&gt;
side of the lifeless body of Adolphus, he burst&lt;br /&gt;
into a violent agony of tears.) Am I not pun-&lt;br /&gt;
ished? (exclaimed he starting up with a phren-&lt;br /&gt;
zied countenance,) I suffer at this moment&lt;br /&gt;
the torments of the damned! His wife,&lt;br /&gt;
too, dead! Who was her slaughterer? You do&lt;br /&gt;
not dare to say that deed was performed by my&lt;br /&gt;
hand! Poor luckless girl! Yet she seems to&lt;br /&gt;
smile upon me. Ah, they told me she had a&lt;br /&gt;
kind and gentle heart: yet, wretch that I was,&lt;br /&gt;
to suffer her to pine in obscurity, when I was&lt;br /&gt;
absolutely wallowing in wealth! But the day&lt;br /&gt;
of retribution has already overtaken me. Oh,&lt;br /&gt;
Middleton, I have my punishment even in this&lt;br /&gt;
life! However, do not teach that boy to curse&lt;br /&gt;
me: and, in pity to my present sufferings, do&lt;br /&gt;
not expose my crimes!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humane Mr. Middleton had already re-&lt;br /&gt;
pented of the part in the dreadful drama which&lt;br /&gt;
he had performed, and felt the most alarming&lt;br /&gt;
apprehensions, lest the senses of the repentant&lt;br /&gt;
Malvolio were turned. He therefore gave him&lt;br /&gt;
a positive promise, not to expose his cruel con-&lt;br /&gt;
duct, or to endeavor to prejudice the mind of&lt;br /&gt;
the child: but the world too late became sensi-&lt;br /&gt;
ble that the injury he had done to Adolphus, and&lt;br /&gt;
his inhuman father was universally despised.–&lt;br /&gt;
The horrors of a reproaching conscience contin-&lt;br /&gt;
ually pursued him: in his dreams he perpetual-&lt;br /&gt;
ly thought he beheld the spirit of his son, accu-&lt;br /&gt;
sing him with being the destroyer of his happi-&lt;br /&gt;
ness, and the murderer of his beloved wife.–&lt;br /&gt;
For three years he lived a life of misery; the&lt;br /&gt;
only happiness he enjoyed was in the presence&lt;br /&gt;
of the child, whom he left the whole of his&lt;br /&gt;
fortune, except an annuity to the worthy Mr. Mid-&lt;br /&gt;
dleton of three hundred a year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preface&quot;&gt;Preface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Journey to Philadelphia, or, Memoirs of Charles Coleman Saunders&lt;/em&gt; was first serialized in &lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register&lt;/em&gt; in 1804. The initial installment appeared on April 14, and the novel ran in six subsequent issues, ending May 19. The author signed the novel simply “Adelio.” The pseudonym is a masculine derivation of the German &lt;em&gt;edel,&lt;/em&gt; which translates to noble. In addition to &lt;em&gt;A Journey to Philadelphia,&lt;/em&gt; Adelio is named as author of 12 other poems and opinion letters in the magazine. One poem is written in German, and translated by another contributor, others written in English. His contributions present a range of topics, including marriage, linguistics, law, German poetry in translation, and nature. All Adelio’s contributions were published in 1804, and several were in the same issues in which &lt;em&gt;A Journey to Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt; appeared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register&lt;/em&gt; was a Philadelphia-based weekly magazine which was published from 1800-1805. According to its terms, a subscription cost four dollars per year, and half that for subscribers in the country outside Philadelphia. Women’s interests were frequent topics in the magazine. According to Lucia McMahon’s study of female roles in American society, venues like &lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Repository&lt;/em&gt; expanded the network of communication in order to propagate and advocate for women’s education. &lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Repository&lt;/em&gt; was a miscellany, committed to publishing a variety of topics, so it is unsurprising the editors would publish pieces which contributed to the national conversation of women’s roles in the nascent republic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adelio’s contributions are not excluded from the conversations on women. In one April 7, 1804 Adelio letter, a case is made against men who bemoan their wives. He warns readers against choosing a marriage partner for beauty and fortune only.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Let those who write against marriage, pause, and reflect–let them
enquire with care, listen candidly, and decide impartially, and I am
much mistaken, if they do not find themselves erring in a most
egregious manner; they will find, that where there are unhappy
couples, it has as frequently been owing to an improper choice; in
many instances the female has been selected for beauty of fortune
only, without any regard to disposition, virtue, or solid
accomplishments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, Adelio echoes other writers of the Early National period by advocating for a filial marriage pairing instead of marriage for financial gain. The April 7 letter sparks a response from L’ami, another contributor, who disagrees with Adelio’s forgiving stance toward women in unhappy marriages. L’ami instead blames incessant female chatter, financial excess, and domineering female spirits to marital strife. Adelio responds by reproaching the writer, and suggesting he read more closely in order to fully understand his points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another entry, Adelio claims a motto, initially in German, then translated to English. “When you write, write so your reader may understand.” Following the German heading, Adelio’s article is a denouncement of foreign language mottos or headings, and he describes them, in essence, as pretentious displays of education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Varied articles like Adelio’s are common to &lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register&lt;/em&gt;. As a miscellany, the magazine ran various entries, including essays, fiction, birth and death announcements, poetry, biographical sketches, theatre information, and music. It was also known to re-print and re-run previous material or material from other periodicals. Edited first by David Hogan, successive editors were John W. Scott and Thomas Irwin. In 1802, the magazine was suspended from July to October due to the Yellow Fever epidemic in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A Journey to Philadelphia’s&lt;/em&gt; protagonist, Charles Coleman Saunders, an idealistic youth from the countryside north of Philadelphia. Saunders, while in search for his trade, is arrested for a murder he witnessed, but did not commit. The true culprit is his double in almost every way, a Freudian &lt;em&gt;unheimlich.&lt;/em&gt; The double, whose name is Carson, attempts a crime due to an unhappy marriage. The stranger’s doubling represents Saunders’ options to choose an unhappy marriage and suffer the consequences, or to choose well and be happy. Emila represents a good marriage pairing, while the marriage of Saunders’ double represents what can happen if prudence and wisdom is not exercised in romantic pursuits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In another subplot, Charles Saunders, like protagonists in Charles Brockden Brown’s &lt;em&gt;Wieland&lt;/em&gt; (1798), faces trials at the hands of a malicious villain, one who threatens his existence and happiness. Like Brown’s Carwin, Carnell has insights to Saunders’ life, his home, and his closest friends. Saunders cannot rid himself of the villain, but unlike Brown’s novel, Saunders’ wrongful conviction shields him from Carnell, while Brown’s Wieland family (of German descent) falls to madness and violence. &lt;em&gt;The Journey to Philadelphia’s&lt;/em&gt; parallels to other popular texts at the time suggests the influence of those works on the writer, and provides ample evidence for the short novel as a gothic tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shortly after its appearance in &lt;em&gt;The Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register, A Journey to Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt; was collected and published as a book by publishers Lincoln and Gleason in 1804. Included in the book was &lt;em&gt;An Interesting Narrative,&lt;/em&gt; another short, anonymously printed tale. That &lt;em&gt;A Journey to Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt; was collected and sold as a text so soon after its initial publication suggests its popularity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1. 14 April 1804]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOME time in the year–, I fre-&lt;br /&gt;
quently visit the prison at Philadelphia,&lt;br /&gt;
for no other purpose than to satisfy curi-&lt;br /&gt;
osity, in one of which visits, I noticed a&lt;br /&gt;
man sitting in a retired part: Something&lt;br /&gt;
in his appearance made me wish for a&lt;br /&gt;
nearer view, to accomplish my purpose,&lt;br /&gt;
I resolved to address him and offer such&lt;br /&gt;
little services, as I knew were agreeable to&lt;br /&gt;
persons in his situation; his counten-&lt;br /&gt;
ance was remarkably interesting, it bore&lt;br /&gt;
the traces of sorrow resisted by a manly&lt;br /&gt;
fortitude; his dress was plain in a much&lt;br /&gt;
greater degree, than was common for&lt;br /&gt;
persons at his age (he appeared about&lt;br /&gt;
twenty;) his manners were mild and pre-&lt;br /&gt;
possessing, and his conversation plainly&lt;br /&gt;
evinced that he possessed no common&lt;br /&gt;
share of intelligence; I afterwards fre-&lt;br /&gt;
quently visited him in his prison and did&lt;br /&gt;
him any little services my power: – I&lt;br /&gt;
would describe his character; but this&lt;br /&gt;
will be better done, representing the fol-&lt;br /&gt;
lowing memoirs of him, written by him-&lt;br /&gt;
self.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TO you my friend who have not&lt;br /&gt;
suffered appearances to make you impen-&lt;br /&gt;
etrable to the voice of truth; and whose&lt;br /&gt;
humanity has alleviated the miseries of&lt;br /&gt;
my situation; I will relate the adven-&lt;br /&gt;
tures of my life; you will find them singu-&lt;br /&gt;
lar and unfortunate, and it will require&lt;br /&gt;
an exertion of all your candor to enable&lt;br /&gt;
you to give credit to the relation; – but&lt;br /&gt;
I have now no motive, even if I had the&lt;br /&gt;
inclination, to deceive you; I shall short-&lt;br /&gt;
ly suffer the punishment due to the crime&lt;br /&gt;
of which I have been convicted, if you&lt;br /&gt;
think he who is standing on the verge of&lt;br /&gt;
eternity, and deeply impressed with a&lt;br /&gt;
proper sense of his situation, will not de-&lt;br /&gt;
ceive you, you will give my story a pa-&lt;br /&gt;
tient and accredited hearing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of my life was passed on&lt;br /&gt;
the banks of the Susquehanna in Penn-&lt;br /&gt;
Sylvania; my father had retired to this&lt;br /&gt;
place to pass his days in the quiet of an&lt;br /&gt;
agricultural life: He was one, who, like&lt;br /&gt;
myself, had early struggled in the thorny&lt;br /&gt;
paths of adversity and misfortune; he&lt;br /&gt;
had once filled a station better suited to&lt;br /&gt;
his talents and industry, and it was chief-&lt;br /&gt;
ly from this excellent being I received&lt;br /&gt;
the little knowledge I have acquired; but&lt;br /&gt;
on this is unnecessary to dwell:– Pro-&lt;br /&gt;
fiting by his instructions, and aided by&lt;br /&gt;
a disposition to enquire into the causes&lt;br /&gt;
of all I saw in the works of nature and&lt;br /&gt;
art, and generally to add to my fund of&lt;br /&gt;
knowledge, I early contracted an aver-&lt;br /&gt;
sion to the dull uniform, and as I then&lt;br /&gt;
thought, uninstructive round of pursuits&lt;br /&gt;
which mark the progress of an agricultu-&lt;br /&gt;
ral life; I sought to distinguish myself&lt;br /&gt;
by becoming eminently useful to man-&lt;br /&gt;
kind; I had read of men who, with no&lt;br /&gt;
unusual talents, but by a proper exertion&lt;br /&gt;
of them, had become celebrated for some&lt;br /&gt;
singular services they had performed;&lt;br /&gt;
and why, thought I, could not I, like&lt;br /&gt;
them become distinguished; the path of&lt;br /&gt;
fame was open to all who have the cour-&lt;br /&gt;
age to tread it; could I not, by application&lt;br /&gt;
and a strenuous exertion of my powers&lt;br /&gt;
give my ideas a greater expansion? If I&lt;br /&gt;
reflected on what I saw, what I did, and&lt;br /&gt;
what was done by others, would it not at&lt;br /&gt;
last lead me to the accomplishment of my&lt;br /&gt;
wishes? There were various methods&lt;br /&gt;
by which I might acquire celebrity and&lt;br /&gt;
honor; in the field, in the cabinet, in the&lt;br /&gt;
study of the arts and sciences; for the&lt;br /&gt;
first I had neither inclination nor taste,&lt;br /&gt;
my disposition was peaceable, I possessed&lt;br /&gt;
none of that terrible kind of courage,&lt;br /&gt;
better called ferocity, which would ena-&lt;br /&gt;
ble me to distinguish myself as a soldier,&lt;br /&gt;
and had I possessed it, I did not enter-&lt;br /&gt;
tain the idea that honest fame could be&lt;br /&gt;
acquired by becoming the greatest of the&lt;br /&gt;
destroyers of the human race, and an in-&lt;br /&gt;
creaser of their already too numerous&lt;br /&gt;
calamities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Politics pleased me as little, I thought&lt;br /&gt;
it would be impossible to preserve my&lt;br /&gt;
integrity, amidst the dangers and tempta-&lt;br /&gt;
tions which usually surround an impor-&lt;br /&gt;
tant political station, I saw that even the&lt;br /&gt;
preservation of this invaluable possession&lt;br /&gt;
would not perhaps eventually accomplish&lt;br /&gt;
my purpose; the best of politicians had&lt;br /&gt;
not all been famous for their virtue;&lt;br /&gt;
even those who had preserved it untaint-&lt;br /&gt;
ed, while they had been extolled by one&lt;br /&gt;
party of men, had been vilified by ano-&lt;br /&gt;
ther; to become celebrated in the pro-&lt;br /&gt;
motion of the arts and sciences, was the&lt;br /&gt;
only path left open to my footsteps, my&lt;br /&gt;
success in this pursuit would displease&lt;br /&gt;
no one, and the applause I might merit&lt;br /&gt;
would be willingly awarded by all.&lt;br /&gt;
Many of my leisure hours had been oc-&lt;br /&gt;
cupied by reflections of this nature, and&lt;br /&gt;
time only served to add strength to my&lt;br /&gt;
resolution; I had already become ac-&lt;br /&gt;
quainted with some of the principles of&lt;br /&gt;
experimental philosophy, my father’s&lt;br /&gt;
books had supplied me with much use-&lt;br /&gt;
ful knowledge in mechanics, hydraulics,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp;c. many an unoccupied hour had been&lt;br /&gt;
passed in applying my theoretical know-&lt;br /&gt;
ledge to practice; I had constructed&lt;br /&gt;
clocks of wood, I had made mills, pumps,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp;c. it is true, they were rude and un-&lt;br /&gt;
finished, but they were my first essays&lt;br /&gt;
and much could not be expected, where&lt;br /&gt;
the only tools used were a saw, hatchet,&lt;br /&gt;
and knife; yet my success served to add&lt;br /&gt;
vigor to my ruling passion; I flattered&lt;br /&gt;
myself that my little machines were con-&lt;br /&gt;
structed on an improved plan, and if I&lt;br /&gt;
could make improvements here, under so&lt;br /&gt;
many disadvantages, what should I not&lt;br /&gt;
be able to perform in the city, where&lt;br /&gt;
these attempts might be made on a more&lt;br /&gt;
extensive scale, and would receive the&lt;br /&gt;
reward due to their merit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To go to the city became my most&lt;br /&gt;
earnest wish; but my father was very&lt;br /&gt;
averse to the scheme, his experience had&lt;br /&gt;
taught him to believe a greater share of&lt;br /&gt;
felicity was attainable in his situation,&lt;br /&gt;
than in the accomplishment of the object&lt;br /&gt;
of my pursuit; I knew he entertained&lt;br /&gt;
this opinion and therefore resolved not to&lt;br /&gt;
consult him, but to act in obedience to&lt;br /&gt;
the dictates of my inclination, without&lt;br /&gt;
his knowledge; it would do him no in-&lt;br /&gt;
jury, my brother was a sufficient assist-&lt;br /&gt;
ant in the ordinary labors of the planta-&lt;br /&gt;
tion, and his circumstances enabled him&lt;br /&gt;
to hire in the case of inability. – My resolu-&lt;br /&gt;
tion was taken, and I had but to put it in&lt;br /&gt;
execution; a journey of a few days&lt;br /&gt;
would bear me to the city: I was well&lt;br /&gt;
acquainted with the roads, accustomed to&lt;br /&gt;
pedestrian feats, and dreaded no danger,&lt;br /&gt;
from a nightly elopement. A circum-&lt;br /&gt;
stance which happened some time before,&lt;br /&gt;
was an additional motive; it had been&lt;br /&gt;
my delight to take a nightly ramble to a&lt;br /&gt;
rock which commanded a fine view of&lt;br /&gt;
the river and surrounding country, here&lt;br /&gt;
I used to sit, or walk, and contemplate&lt;br /&gt;
the beauties of nature, when the mild ra-&lt;br /&gt;
diance of the moon displayed all the ro-&lt;br /&gt;
mantic beauties of the surrounding&lt;br /&gt;
scene, in its richest, though softest tints;&lt;br /&gt;
nor was this my only employment, I had&lt;br /&gt;
a smattering of astronomy, I could name&lt;br /&gt;
most of the constellations, and loved to&lt;br /&gt;
gaze over, and reflect on the innumera-&lt;br /&gt;
ble glories of the heavens; returning&lt;br /&gt;
from an excursion of this kind, I was&lt;br /&gt;
alarmed by a cry of distress, I started–&lt;br /&gt;
the natural timidity of my disposition&lt;br /&gt;
gave way to the idea, that I might per-&lt;br /&gt;
haps, be serviceable to some person in&lt;br /&gt;
distress, the voice was that of a female,&lt;br /&gt;
but from whence could it proceed? I&lt;br /&gt;
knew no female would willingly be&lt;br /&gt;
abroad at this solitary hour, in a country&lt;br /&gt;
but thinly settled; the idea of robbers&lt;br /&gt;
occurred, – the shriek was heard again,&lt;br /&gt;
it was near me; and I quickly saw a&lt;br /&gt;
man attempting to bear a struggling fe-&lt;br /&gt;
male from the public road; I rushed up-&lt;br /&gt;
on him, – a desperate struggle ensued,&lt;br /&gt;
in which I proved victorious; mean-&lt;br /&gt;
while, the lady had fled, but the momen-&lt;br /&gt;
tary view I had of her features awaken-&lt;br /&gt;
ed sensations of a new and unaccountable&lt;br /&gt;
kind; the first wish they produced was,&lt;br /&gt;
a desire to behold again, the object which&lt;br /&gt;
had excited them; the man who had&lt;br /&gt;
yielded to my superior strength had fled,&lt;br /&gt;
I had no right to detain him, I had ac-&lt;br /&gt;
complished my object; but now a new&lt;br /&gt;
one occupied my attention: I hasted to&lt;br /&gt;
search after the female, I searched the&lt;br /&gt;
road, the wood, but in vain, she was no&lt;br /&gt;
where to be found; and I returned home&lt;br /&gt;
weary, dissatisfied and perplexed.&lt;br /&gt;
All my enquiries with regard to the&lt;br /&gt;
lady, were fruitless, – my affairs pro-&lt;br /&gt;
ceded in their wonted course for some&lt;br /&gt;
time; my nocturnal rambles were con-&lt;br /&gt;
tinued, and my speculations with regard&lt;br /&gt;
to the future were still indulged; one&lt;br /&gt;
night I was returning home from my&lt;br /&gt;
favorite spot, I noticed a man crossing&lt;br /&gt;
the path which led to my father’s dwell-&lt;br /&gt;
ing; surprised at an appearance so un-&lt;br /&gt;
common, I was endeavoring to guess&lt;br /&gt;
what could induce anyone, besides my-&lt;br /&gt;
self, to wander through the woods at this&lt;br /&gt;
late hour; from these reflections, I was&lt;br /&gt;
roused by a pistol shot, which deprived&lt;br /&gt;
me for a time, of sentation&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;; I know not&lt;br /&gt;
how long I remained in this state, and&lt;br /&gt;
when I recovered, found I had sustained&lt;br /&gt;
but little injury; how I happened to es-&lt;br /&gt;
cape so well, I know not, whether it had&lt;br /&gt;
been fired from a great distance, had&lt;br /&gt;
spent its force by striking against a tree,&lt;br /&gt;
or been deadened by the resistance of my&lt;br /&gt;
hat and a large handkerchief, which I&lt;br /&gt;
had bound round my head to relieve a&lt;br /&gt;
violent head-ache, I am unable to deter-&lt;br /&gt;
mine; but I was happy I had received so&lt;br /&gt;
small an injury.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A new train of reflections and surmis-&lt;br /&gt;
es were new exited; I asked myself&lt;br /&gt;
who could be the person that fired; it&lt;br /&gt;
was evident it was an enemy; every con-&lt;br /&gt;
current circumstance, the hour, the place,&lt;br /&gt;
seemed to impress this belief; but who&lt;br /&gt;
would it be? I had injured no being on&lt;br /&gt;
earth, I was almost a stranger (owing to&lt;br /&gt;
my romantic notions) even to my nearest&lt;br /&gt;
neighbors; I was totally unable to form&lt;br /&gt;
any rational conjecture; I soon recover-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the slight injury I had sustained; the&lt;br /&gt;
circumstance no longer caused any anxi-&lt;br /&gt;
ety, and I again ventured to revisit my&lt;br /&gt;
favorite retreat;–returning home one&lt;br /&gt;
night, as I passed through my brother’s&lt;br /&gt;
chamber to gain my own, I saw by the&lt;br /&gt;
light of the moon, the figure of a man&lt;br /&gt;
standing near the bed of my brother,&lt;br /&gt;
armed with a dagger; I stood almost pe-&lt;br /&gt;
trified with fear and astonishment; I&lt;br /&gt;
had imbibed from our rustic neighbors,&lt;br /&gt;
some superstitious ideas, it was near,&lt;br /&gt;
“the noon of night,” that solemn hour,&lt;br /&gt;
when the dead forsake their graves, and&lt;br /&gt;
wander forth to revisit scenes once dear&lt;br /&gt;
to them; I believed I saw a spectre; I&lt;br /&gt;
made no alarm, my tongue clave to the&lt;br /&gt;
roof of my mouth, horror almost froze&lt;br /&gt;
the blood in my veins, and my limbs&lt;br /&gt;
scarcely supported my tottering frame!&lt;br /&gt;
The figure moved towards me, – I made&lt;br /&gt;
a desperate effort, reached my chamber&lt;br /&gt;
and locked the door; the silence of death&lt;br /&gt;
reigned in the house, – not a sound reach-&lt;br /&gt;
ed my ear; I gave myself up to reflec-&lt;br /&gt;
tion: could, I asked, this figure be an in-&lt;br /&gt;
habitant of the grave? Was it probable&lt;br /&gt;
that the dead could leave the earth, and&lt;br /&gt;
rise to sport with the terrors of mankind?&lt;br /&gt;
Would they come armed with the wea-&lt;br /&gt;
pons of death? My reason would not&lt;br /&gt;
suffer me to cherish the thought, my cou-&lt;br /&gt;
rage returned, I left the room and search-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the house in silence, for now I believ-&lt;br /&gt;
ed it must be a robber I had seen; but I&lt;br /&gt;
found no one, every thing was save, and&lt;br /&gt;
returning to my bed, I puzzled myself&lt;br /&gt;
with fain conjectures, till sleep wrapped&lt;br /&gt;
my senses in forgetfulness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, I enquired if any noise&lt;br /&gt;
had been heard in the night? And No,&lt;br /&gt;
was the answer; no one had heard any&lt;br /&gt;
thing, their slumbers had been sound and&lt;br /&gt;
uninterrupted; I evaded answering with&lt;br /&gt;
truth to the consequent enquiries, by say-&lt;br /&gt;
ing I had dreamed a frightful dream.&lt;br /&gt;
The next night I again saw the same&lt;br /&gt;
figure, but I was now convinced it was&lt;br /&gt;
no spectre, but a man; at the sight of me&lt;br /&gt;
he fled, and passed through the door&lt;br /&gt;
which I had by accident left unfastened;&lt;br /&gt;
a new cause of wonder here presented it-&lt;br /&gt;
self: who could this man be? and what&lt;br /&gt;
was his object? were questions which&lt;br /&gt;
naturally occurred; my father frequently&lt;br /&gt;
left his bed and traversed the house in&lt;br /&gt;
his sleep; but it was certain this was&lt;br /&gt;
not him. By what means could he have&lt;br /&gt;
entered the house? I had fastened the&lt;br /&gt;
door and had the key in my pock-&lt;br /&gt;
et; he was armed; this gave birth to a&lt;br /&gt;
new idea; it was evident his intentions&lt;br /&gt;
were dreadful; my adventure on a pre-&lt;br /&gt;
ceding night was remembered; my life&lt;br /&gt;
had been aimed at, and it was probable&lt;br /&gt;
it was again attempted; my thoughts&lt;br /&gt;
however, fixed themselves on no deter-&lt;br /&gt;
minate object, until I recalled the remem-&lt;br /&gt;
brance of the female whose rescue I had&lt;br /&gt;
effected; that man whom I had defeat-&lt;br /&gt;
ed, he then, I concluded, must be the one&lt;br /&gt;
who had fired the pistol, and whom I&lt;br /&gt;
twice met armed in my brother’s cham-&lt;br /&gt;
ber, – he wished to revenge himself&lt;br /&gt;
on the author of his defeat, he had attempted&lt;br /&gt;
to destroy my brother through mistake,&lt;br /&gt;
and my appearance had alone saved his&lt;br /&gt;
life. There now appeared to be an ab-&lt;br /&gt;
solute necessity of taking some measures&lt;br /&gt;
to counteract his schemes; and in form-&lt;br /&gt;
ing plans of this nature I busied myself,&lt;br /&gt;
till a new thought displaced my former&lt;br /&gt;
ones. It now appeared plain to me, that&lt;br /&gt;
this man had discovered his error, or&lt;br /&gt;
why did he not (believing I slept in the bed&lt;br /&gt;
of my brother) pierce his bosom with&lt;br /&gt;
the dagger; there was nothing to pre-&lt;br /&gt;
vent him, my brother was sleeping, he&lt;br /&gt;
might have killed him, retired in silence,&lt;br /&gt;
and the dark mantle of oblivion, would&lt;br /&gt;
have hidden the secret from the know-&lt;br /&gt;
ledge of man. It was now evident my&lt;br /&gt;
life was attempted; he had found means&lt;br /&gt;
to descend the chimney, and enter my&lt;br /&gt;
brother’s chamber, as by this means only,&lt;br /&gt;
he could enter mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(to be continued)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ 2. 21 April 1804]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is no fear which acts so&lt;br /&gt;
powerfully on the mind of man, as that&lt;br /&gt;
which bids him guard against no deter-&lt;br /&gt;
minate object or attempt; my death was&lt;br /&gt;
certainly intended. To meet it face to&lt;br /&gt;
face in any form (though constitutionally&lt;br /&gt;
timid) I thought possible; but to be for-&lt;br /&gt;
ever in danger, to be taken off by a bullet&lt;br /&gt;
while I believed myself safe, to drink the&lt;br /&gt;
draught of death, when I thought myself&lt;br /&gt;
restoring vigor to my exhausted frame,&lt;br /&gt;
or to perish when lying defenceless and&lt;br /&gt;
reposing in the arms of sleep – these&lt;br /&gt;
were dangers to encounter for which all&lt;br /&gt;
my courage was unequal, and which could&lt;br /&gt;
only be avoided by removing from my&lt;br /&gt;
present abode; once gone, my enemy’s&lt;br /&gt;
scheme of revenge would be relinquish-&lt;br /&gt;
ed; if I remained, I should one time or&lt;br /&gt;
other, become its victim. My journey&lt;br /&gt;
to the city was again resolved upon and&lt;br /&gt;
executed. At midnight I left my father’s&lt;br /&gt;
house, but without any intention to re-&lt;br /&gt;
turn: I took nothing with me except a&lt;br /&gt;
small sum of money: I imparted my in-&lt;br /&gt;
tention to no one: I may be blamed for&lt;br /&gt;
leaving my friends thus abruptly, in anx-&lt;br /&gt;
iety and suspense respecting my fate;&lt;br /&gt;
but I thought it wrong to alarm them, as&lt;br /&gt;
they could not possibly remove the cause&lt;br /&gt;
of my danger; they would have persuad-&lt;br /&gt;
ed me to remain, or by their means my&lt;br /&gt;
future residence would be discovered,&lt;br /&gt;
CARNELL (the being whom I believed to&lt;br /&gt;
be my secret enemy) would pursue me,&lt;br /&gt;
and I should be subject to incessant&lt;br /&gt;
alarms; perhaps you may think my con-&lt;br /&gt;
clusions unwarranted; if so, remember&lt;br /&gt;
they were the conclusions of one, who&lt;br /&gt;
was unable, from the singularity of the&lt;br /&gt;
case, to receive advantages from the judg-&lt;br /&gt;
ement of others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did not, however, leave my father’s&lt;br /&gt;
house without emotion, I could not de-&lt;br /&gt;
ny myself the secret satisfaction of vis-&lt;br /&gt;
iting every spot, which recollection made&lt;br /&gt;
dear to my heart, the nocturnal seat&lt;br /&gt;
was not forgotten; once more I repair-&lt;br /&gt;
ed thither and seated myself in the usual&lt;br /&gt;
place; – the night was calm and clear,&lt;br /&gt;
not a cloud obscured the splendors of the&lt;br /&gt;
etherial vault of heaven, the moon was&lt;br /&gt;
full and her beams seemed to repose on&lt;br /&gt;
the tranquil bosom of the water; every&lt;br /&gt;
sound was hushed, save when the zephyr&lt;br /&gt;
sighed through the foliage of the venera-&lt;br /&gt;
ble oaks. – It brought to my recollection&lt;br /&gt;
the celebrated night-piece of &lt;em&gt;Homer&lt;/em&gt;, –&lt;br /&gt;
thus translated by &lt;em&gt;Pope&lt;/em&gt;:–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As when the moon, refulgent lamp of night,&lt;br /&gt;
O’er heav’n’s clear azure casts her sacred light,&lt;br /&gt;
When not a breeze disturbs the blue serene,&lt;br /&gt;
And not a cloud o’ercasts the solemn scene;&lt;br /&gt;
Around her throne the vivid planets roll,&lt;br /&gt;
And stars unnumber’d gild the glowing pole;&lt;br /&gt;
O’er the dark trees a yellower lustre shed,&lt;br /&gt;
And tip with silver ev’ry mountain’s head.–&lt;br /&gt;
Then shine the vales, the rocks in prospect rise;&lt;br /&gt;
A flood of glory bursts from all the skies;&lt;br /&gt;
The conscious swains exulting in the sight,&lt;br /&gt;
Eye the blue vault, and bless the useful light.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me who was about to leave it, per-&lt;br /&gt;
haps forever, this scene appeared unusu-&lt;br /&gt;
ally interesting; I knew not how long I&lt;br /&gt;
sat occupied with various reflections,&lt;br /&gt;
when I was roused by the sound of ap-&lt;br /&gt;
proaching footsteps; I started, and look-&lt;br /&gt;
ed around, I saw a young woman at no&lt;br /&gt;
great distance from me, in her hand she&lt;br /&gt;
held an open letter; her movements were&lt;br /&gt;
wild, irregular, she would look on the&lt;br /&gt;
letter, and then on heaven; I watched&lt;br /&gt;
her with attention and solicitude; the&lt;br /&gt;
adventure was of a singular nature; this&lt;br /&gt;
was a place not frequented by any human&lt;br /&gt;
being except myself, at least I had not&lt;br /&gt;
seen any one here at this hour. Could&lt;br /&gt;
she be seeking any one here! This&lt;br /&gt;
seemed improbable, and her attention&lt;br /&gt;
seemed wholly absorbed by the letter. –&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly she exclaimed, I can bear this&lt;br /&gt;
torture no longer, rushed towards&lt;br /&gt;
the river; I started from my seat, and&lt;br /&gt;
flew to prevent her; I seized her but she&lt;br /&gt;
eluded my grasp, shrieked, and leaped&lt;br /&gt;
into the water! In a moment all was&lt;br /&gt;
again silent; to descend to the river at&lt;br /&gt;
this spot, could not be accomplished&lt;br /&gt;
without immanent risk; I looked down&lt;br /&gt;
on the stream, but the overhanging rocks&lt;br /&gt;
cast a deep shade over it, and I saw her&lt;br /&gt;
no more: Some distressing occurrence&lt;br /&gt;
had probably overpowered her reason,&lt;br /&gt;
and in a moment of despair and insani-&lt;br /&gt;
ty she had put an end to her existence;&lt;br /&gt;
she had chosen the hour of midnight for&lt;br /&gt;
this purpose, when she thought the deed&lt;br /&gt;
would be concealed from every human&lt;br /&gt;
eye; I however, had been a melancholy&lt;br /&gt;
witness to the shocking catastrophe.&lt;br /&gt;
Her friends would wonder whither she&lt;br /&gt;
had fled – I only could tell; her corse&lt;br /&gt;
would be borne down the stream, it&lt;br /&gt;
would perhaps be found when corruption&lt;br /&gt;
had made the features indistinguisha-&lt;br /&gt;
ble; conjectures would be formed as to&lt;br /&gt;
who it had been, and how it came there;&lt;br /&gt;
and I alone, could answer all these ques-&lt;br /&gt;
tions; but should I endeavor to discover&lt;br /&gt;
who it was, should I inform her friends,&lt;br /&gt;
what had been her fate; I should be&lt;br /&gt;
seized as the perpetrator of the deed: I&lt;br /&gt;
might indeed discover the truth, but&lt;br /&gt;
they would not believe it; I should suf-&lt;br /&gt;
fer by my sincerity, I should at least be&lt;br /&gt;
blamed for not preventing it; this I&lt;br /&gt;
might have done, but how was I to ima-&lt;br /&gt;
gine her intention? Self-destruction was&lt;br /&gt;
a deed of which I thought mankind in-&lt;br /&gt;
capable, and when convinced of the con-&lt;br /&gt;
trary, it was too late – the deed was&lt;br /&gt;
done; the past could not be recalled. I&lt;br /&gt;
resolved to leave every thing to its&lt;br /&gt;
course; no one had witnessed her end&lt;br /&gt;
but myself, and I would, for many re-&lt;br /&gt;
asons, be induced to conceal it, her&lt;br /&gt;
friends would be benefited by this pro-&lt;br /&gt;
cedure, they would suppose her death,&lt;br /&gt;
(if the intelligence of it reached them) ac-&lt;br /&gt;
cidental, and be spared the dreadful cer-&lt;br /&gt;
tainty of its being intentionally effected.&lt;br /&gt;
I pursued my journey, and reached the&lt;br /&gt;
city in safety; here new difficulties pre-&lt;br /&gt;
sented themselves; my object had been&lt;br /&gt;
to offer myself as an apprentice to a&lt;br /&gt;
watchmaker; but who would take me?&lt;br /&gt;
I was acquainted with no human being,&lt;br /&gt;
though surrounded by so many thou-&lt;br /&gt;
sands, I was unknown and unrecommend-&lt;br /&gt;
ded; in the mean time I might be ap-&lt;br /&gt;
prehended as a thief, or confined as a&lt;br /&gt;
vagrant or runaway; this might be pre-&lt;br /&gt;
vented by a disclosure of the truth, but&lt;br /&gt;
its concealment was necessary to my pur-&lt;br /&gt;
pose; in addition to this, food was abso-&lt;br /&gt;
lutely necessary; my stock of money&lt;br /&gt;
was almost exhausted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those who have lived remote from&lt;br /&gt;
cities, have not a just conception of the&lt;br /&gt;
real necessity of money; provisions for&lt;br /&gt;
a day, lodgings for a night, might be had&lt;br /&gt;
in many parts of the country gratis, and&lt;br /&gt;
would be received as the offering of hos-&lt;br /&gt;
pitality, a virtue more practised in the&lt;br /&gt;
country, than in town: The little cash I&lt;br /&gt;
had yet remaining would not, here, pur-&lt;br /&gt;
chase more food than was necessary for&lt;br /&gt;
a single meal; the haughty indepen-&lt;br /&gt;
dence of my spirit would not permit me&lt;br /&gt;
to ask a favor, and my soul revolted at&lt;br /&gt;
the thought of stealing; I shuddered&lt;br /&gt;
when I reflected on the condition to&lt;br /&gt;
which my imprudence had reduced me;&lt;br /&gt;
a secret voice whispered, “you have&lt;br /&gt;
done wrong;” but to return was too late,&lt;br /&gt;
and the evils I had fled from would again&lt;br /&gt;
be encountered; my situation was sim-&lt;br /&gt;
ilar to that of a man in the midst of a&lt;br /&gt;
rapid stream; it was at least as easy to&lt;br /&gt;
proceed as to return, my course was&lt;br /&gt;
pointed out, and I could do nothing&lt;br /&gt;
more than rush on boldly to the endur-&lt;br /&gt;
ance of whatever ills I was doomed to&lt;br /&gt;
suffer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I knocked at the door of a watchmaker&lt;br /&gt;
in market-street, and was soon ushered&lt;br /&gt;
into the room, where sat the master and&lt;br /&gt;
his family, in a manner which plainly&lt;br /&gt;
evinced my embarrassment; I told him&lt;br /&gt;
my business; his dark, unprepossessing&lt;br /&gt;
features were contracted, and his pene-&lt;br /&gt;
trating eyes seemed to pierce my&lt;br /&gt;
very soul: He asked my name, place of&lt;br /&gt;
abode, &amp;amp;c. I told him no falsehoods,&lt;br /&gt;
neither did I tell him the whole truth; I&lt;br /&gt;
did not tell him my father’s dislike to my&lt;br /&gt;
pursuit; after much conversation of an&lt;br /&gt;
uninteresting nature, he said, “your sto-&lt;br /&gt;
ry does not seem improbable, your ap-&lt;br /&gt;
pearance seems to evince the truth of&lt;br /&gt;
some parts of it, but if I take you as an&lt;br /&gt;
apprentice, what security can you give&lt;br /&gt;
me, for your good conduct, and indus-&lt;br /&gt;
try.” All I have to give, I replied, is the&lt;br /&gt;
word of a man of honor, who values his&lt;br /&gt;
word too highly, to promise what he&lt;br /&gt;
does not intend to perform. The term,&lt;br /&gt;
I believe sounded strangely in his ears,&lt;br /&gt;
it was indeed ludicrously contrasted&lt;br /&gt;
with my homely dress, and awkward ap-&lt;br /&gt;
pearance, and I believe he was about to&lt;br /&gt;
refuse me, when the entrance of a young&lt;br /&gt;
lady put an end to this interval of sus-&lt;br /&gt;
pense, and created another; she cast an&lt;br /&gt;
enquiring look upon me; I felt still&lt;br /&gt;
more distressed, and held down my head,&lt;br /&gt;
confused and confounded, when a sud-&lt;br /&gt;
den exclamation from her, of “Can it be&lt;br /&gt;
possible?” effectually roused me, “can&lt;br /&gt;
what be possible?” said every one in the&lt;br /&gt;
same instant; she answered not, but hast-&lt;br /&gt;
ening to me, she seized my hand; I was&lt;br /&gt;
now convinced my conjectures were&lt;br /&gt;
right; when she spoke, I thought the&lt;br /&gt;
voice familiar to my ear, at least that I&lt;br /&gt;
had somewhere heard it before; a sight&lt;br /&gt;
of her features told me where, my hand&lt;br /&gt;
trembled in hers, and I flattered myself&lt;br /&gt;
she was not without emotion: You have,&lt;br /&gt;
no doubt, already guessed who this lady&lt;br /&gt;
was, you will remember my adventure&lt;br /&gt;
in the wood when I saved her from the&lt;br /&gt;
violence of CARNELL: An explanation&lt;br /&gt;
ensued, and I received the thanks of her&lt;br /&gt;
family; my first request was granted,&lt;br /&gt;
and I became an apprentice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(to be continued)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ 3. 28 April 1804]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TIME rolled rapidly along; my&lt;br /&gt;
exertions pleased Mr. BRANART; my&lt;br /&gt;
knowledge increased; my reading, and&lt;br /&gt;
conversation with man, enlarged my&lt;br /&gt;
mind, whilst it corrected many of my er-&lt;br /&gt;
rors; my hopes of distinction were raised,&lt;br /&gt;
I thought I saw the path of fame open as I&lt;br /&gt;
travelled: Mean time my leisure hours&lt;br /&gt;
were passed in the society of the amiable&lt;br /&gt;
EMILIA BRANART, the first impressions&lt;br /&gt;
which I had felt at the sight of her, were&lt;br /&gt;
strengthened and confirmed; nor did I&lt;br /&gt;
think her opinion of me unfavorable, and&lt;br /&gt;
I believed I should have no cause to re-&lt;br /&gt;
pent my journey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this pleasing calm, this feast on&lt;br /&gt;
lively hopes of future prosperity, distinc-&lt;br /&gt;
tion and happiness, was doomed to be in-&lt;br /&gt;
terrupted, by an alarming circumstance:&lt;br /&gt;
I had been sent to repair a clock at the&lt;br /&gt;
house of a gentleman in race-street; re-&lt;br /&gt;
turning home, just as I stepped on the&lt;br /&gt;
pavement, I saw a stage coach arrive at a&lt;br /&gt;
neighboring house; wishing to see if any&lt;br /&gt;
of the passengers were known to me, I&lt;br /&gt;
stopped and to my astonishment, saw&lt;br /&gt;
CARNELL descend from it; a cold shud-&lt;br /&gt;
dering seized me; the sight of this be-&lt;br /&gt;
ing filled me with sensations of a dread-&lt;br /&gt;
ful nature; they were connected with a&lt;br /&gt;
sense of the dangers to which I thought&lt;br /&gt;
myself again exposed; this man I was&lt;br /&gt;
convinced, had sought to destroy me,&lt;br /&gt;
and now again haunted me for the same&lt;br /&gt;
dreadful purpose. Yet, how could he&lt;br /&gt;
have discovered my residence? I had&lt;br /&gt;
imparted no hints of the place of my de-&lt;br /&gt;
stination on quitting my native spot, to&lt;br /&gt;
any human being; yet he was here;&lt;br /&gt;
causes with which I was wholly uncon-&lt;br /&gt;
nected, might have induced him to visit&lt;br /&gt;
Philadelphia; pleasure, business for&lt;br /&gt;
aught I knew, this city might be his home,&lt;br /&gt;
yet I still labored under the conviction&lt;br /&gt;
that I, and I alone, was the object of his&lt;br /&gt;
journey, to gratify his revenge, to em-&lt;br /&gt;
brue his hands in the blood of an innocent&lt;br /&gt;
man. And was his vengeance to be gra-&lt;br /&gt;
tified only by my destruction? Was there&lt;br /&gt;
no method of warding off the impending&lt;br /&gt;
danger? Could I not cause him to be ap-&lt;br /&gt;
prehended? I had seen him in my cham-&lt;br /&gt;
ber, armed with the instruments of death,&lt;br /&gt;
at the hour of midnight; but I was the&lt;br /&gt;
only one; my voice alone would not&lt;br /&gt;
condemn him, and if it would, dare I&lt;br /&gt;
charge him with meditating a deed, of&lt;br /&gt;
which he had perhaps never formed an&lt;br /&gt;
idea? It was at least possible, I might&lt;br /&gt;
be mistaken, it might have been some&lt;br /&gt;
other, my apprehensions had probably&lt;br /&gt;
deceived my senses; these and many&lt;br /&gt;
more reflections passed rapidly though&lt;br /&gt;
my mind, but produced no other effect&lt;br /&gt;
than to confuse it with the uncertainty&lt;br /&gt;
of probabilities, and the horrors of appre-&lt;br /&gt;
hension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nothing, however could be done; no&lt;br /&gt;
means could be pursued, to ensure my&lt;br /&gt;
safety, or lull my fears. I was obliged&lt;br /&gt;
to wait with patience the unfolding of&lt;br /&gt;
this mystery, and prepare myself to meet,&lt;br /&gt;
with firmness, whatever might happen.&lt;br /&gt;
Walking in the state-house garden&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
was a favorite amusement with EMILIA;&lt;br /&gt;
thither I frequently attended her, when&lt;br /&gt;
the warmth of the summer days, made&lt;br /&gt;
the coolness of the evening, and the frag-&lt;br /&gt;
rance of the garden inviting; here, en-&lt;br /&gt;
joying the society and conversation of&lt;br /&gt;
the object of my fondest affections, – I&lt;br /&gt;
was suddenly seized by two officers of&lt;br /&gt;
justice: I was surprized[^3], and enquired&lt;br /&gt;
their business, “Our business, Sir,” said&lt;br /&gt;
one of them, “is with you.” You have&lt;br /&gt;
mistaken your object said I, with me you&lt;br /&gt;
have no possible business; they howev-&lt;br /&gt;
er, insisted they were right, they men-&lt;br /&gt;
tioned my name, and even my former&lt;br /&gt;
place of abode; after a vain altercation I&lt;br /&gt;
accompanied them to the mayor’s office,&lt;br /&gt;
and answered many questions, and was&lt;br /&gt;
finally informed I was charged with the&lt;br /&gt;
crime of murder! You may form some&lt;br /&gt;
idea of my astonishment at the informa-&lt;br /&gt;
tion; EMILIA had accompanied me to&lt;br /&gt;
the mayor’s she believed the officers la-&lt;br /&gt;
bored under some mistake, and her feel-&lt;br /&gt;
ings may easily be conceived when she&lt;br /&gt;
found me charged with the commission&lt;br /&gt;
of so detestable a crime; yet what she&lt;br /&gt;
knew of my character and conduct, seem-&lt;br /&gt;
ed not to accord with that of a murder-&lt;br /&gt;
er; she requested I should not be sent&lt;br /&gt;
to prison; she believed me innocent,&lt;br /&gt;
and related those events of my life which&lt;br /&gt;
had fallen under her observation: The&lt;br /&gt;
mayor was a humane man, but he was&lt;br /&gt;
compelled to fulfil the duties of his of-&lt;br /&gt;
fice; “All you have stated,” said he,&lt;br /&gt;
“may be true,” but I, he observed, was&lt;br /&gt;
charged with the murder of a young&lt;br /&gt;
woman, who had long been missing. I&lt;br /&gt;
had entered the city under very sus-&lt;br /&gt;
picious circumstances &amp;amp;c. if I was innocent&lt;br /&gt;
the truth would shortly appear; this was&lt;br /&gt;
not the place of my trial, his duty, how-&lt;br /&gt;
ever, obliged him to confine me, and I&lt;br /&gt;
was sent to prison!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of all the strange adventures I had&lt;br /&gt;
met with, this was the furthest above my&lt;br /&gt;
comprehension: I could recollect no&lt;br /&gt;
circumstances of my life which could pos-&lt;br /&gt;
sibly create suspicions of this nature:&lt;br /&gt;
I did not think myself a dubious charac-&lt;br /&gt;
ter; during my residence in the city I&lt;br /&gt;
had led a quiet and inoffensive life;&lt;br /&gt;
how then was this to be accounted for?&lt;br /&gt;
It was evident some person had lodged&lt;br /&gt;
information which would justify my con-&lt;br /&gt;
finement, in the judgment of the may-&lt;br /&gt;
or; but here I was almost entirely a&lt;br /&gt;
stranger, and who, except actuated by&lt;br /&gt;
the spirit of a demon, would accuse me&lt;br /&gt;
of any crime, without possessing at least&lt;br /&gt;
a shadow of proof; the crime too, was&lt;br /&gt;
so detestable, I had never even meditate-&lt;br /&gt;
ed it; I was lost and bewildered amidst&lt;br /&gt;
innumerable and useless conjectures: At&lt;br /&gt;
length the idea of CARNELL occurred,&lt;br /&gt;
and with it a train of terrifying images;&lt;br /&gt;
might not he, I asked, have caused my&lt;br /&gt;
apprehension? Might he have not sub-&lt;br /&gt;
orned some desperate villains, to prove&lt;br /&gt;
me guilty of the crime? The conjecture&lt;br /&gt;
seemed probable: instigated by revenge,&lt;br /&gt;
he had already sought my destruction;&lt;br /&gt;
and was not he who could deliberately&lt;br /&gt;
meditate the death of an innocent man,&lt;br /&gt;
capable of any deed, however enormous&lt;br /&gt;
and detestable? Thus did I bewilder my&lt;br /&gt;
senses endeavoring to guess why I&lt;br /&gt;
had been apprehended; my few friends,&lt;br /&gt;
in the mean time, visited me in prison;&lt;br /&gt;
they believed me innocent, and endeav-&lt;br /&gt;
ored to impress a belief, that I would, on&lt;br /&gt;
trial, be proved so, and be honorably ac-&lt;br /&gt;
quitted; for this occasion, I summoned&lt;br /&gt;
all my firmness to my aid, yet I could not&lt;br /&gt;
avoid reflecting with pain on the misfor-&lt;br /&gt;
tunes I had encountered in consequence&lt;br /&gt;
of quitting my paternal home; I had left&lt;br /&gt;
it, chiefly to avoid assassination, and was&lt;br /&gt;
now to suffer death, (perhaps) for a crime&lt;br /&gt;
of the commission of which I was inno-&lt;br /&gt;
cent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(to be continued)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ 4. 5 May 1804]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE day of trial came; I was con-&lt;br /&gt;
ducted to the bar of the supreme court;&lt;br /&gt;
the eyes of hundreds were upon me; the&lt;br /&gt;
usual question was asked, “&lt;em&gt;Are you guil-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ty? or not guilty?”&lt;/em&gt; I replied with firm-&lt;br /&gt;
ness “Not guilty!” when the charge was&lt;br /&gt;
read, and I was accused of drowning a&lt;br /&gt;
young woman, by forcibly pushing her&lt;br /&gt;
into the river &lt;em&gt;Susquehanna!&lt;/em&gt; A smother-&lt;br /&gt;
ed groan was heard from the audience;&lt;br /&gt;
it was not excited by an emotion of pity&lt;br /&gt;
for me, but was a proof of their detesta-&lt;br /&gt;
tion of the author of so shocking a deed;&lt;br /&gt;
I did not blame it, it was honorable to&lt;br /&gt;
their feelings, and evinced the rectitude&lt;br /&gt;
of their hearts. I now found to my sur-&lt;br /&gt;
prise, I was tried for the murder of her&lt;br /&gt;
whose life I would gladly have saved,&lt;br /&gt;
and whose unfortunate end I thought no&lt;br /&gt;
eye, save mine, had witnessed; it now&lt;br /&gt;
appeared, some others had witnessed it&lt;br /&gt;
besides me, but who, and why I was&lt;br /&gt;
charged with the crime, were circum-&lt;br /&gt;
stances, to me, inexplicable. The wit-&lt;br /&gt;
nesses now appeared, but guess, if you&lt;br /&gt;
can, my sensations, when the first I saw,&lt;br /&gt;
was (CARNELL) the same dreadful being&lt;br /&gt;
I had seen in my brother’s chamber, I&lt;br /&gt;
shuddered; my heart beat tremulously&lt;br /&gt;
in my bosom; my sight grew dim, and&lt;br /&gt;
I almost fainted; the spectators seemed&lt;br /&gt;
to consider my emotion a proof of my&lt;br /&gt;
guilt, but they were mistaken. The tri-&lt;br /&gt;
al continued, and new sources of inde-&lt;br /&gt;
scribable astonishment and wonder were&lt;br /&gt;
every moment displayed. The sub-&lt;br /&gt;
stance of the evidence was as follows–&lt;br /&gt;
“That I had planned and effected the&lt;br /&gt;
death of SUSAN WARFIELD; I had been&lt;br /&gt;
heard to say, I would destroy her, by&lt;br /&gt;
any means in my power; that knowing&lt;br /&gt;
she had frequented the scene of her death,&lt;br /&gt;
I had laid in ambush (armed) to effect&lt;br /&gt;
my purpose, and had been seen by the&lt;br /&gt;
evidence (who were fishing at a little&lt;br /&gt;
distance, though in a situation which&lt;br /&gt;
precluded all possibility of rendering as-&lt;br /&gt;
sistance) to push her forcibly into the&lt;br /&gt;
water, where there was little probability&lt;br /&gt;
of her escaping:” All this was new to&lt;br /&gt;
me, so far from planning her death, I had&lt;br /&gt;
scarcely known her, she had consequent-&lt;br /&gt;
ly never given me any cause of offence,&lt;br /&gt;
I was certainly ignorant of the visits of&lt;br /&gt;
any one but myself to the spot I had cho-&lt;br /&gt;
sen for my nocturnal seat; the exertion&lt;br /&gt;
I had made to save her, might, it was&lt;br /&gt;
true, be mistaken for the different one, by&lt;br /&gt;
persons who had seen the transaction&lt;br /&gt;
from a distance; but that it should be&lt;br /&gt;
said, I had declared my intention to de-&lt;br /&gt;
stroy her, and that I had concealed my-&lt;br /&gt;
self to effect this purpose, was really as-&lt;br /&gt;
tonishing: But the witnesses were suf-&lt;br /&gt;
ficient, respectable, positive and uniform&lt;br /&gt;
in their depositions. I had nothing to&lt;br /&gt;
offer in my defence but the truth, but&lt;br /&gt;
who would give credit to the relation of&lt;br /&gt;
one who stood convicted of so foul a&lt;br /&gt;
crime, who had secretly left his native&lt;br /&gt;
home, and entered the city in a manner&lt;br /&gt;
not ill calculated to excite suspicion, had&lt;br /&gt;
concealed his true name and passed un-&lt;br /&gt;
der a different one (CHARLES COLEMAN)&lt;br /&gt;
and betrayed evident marks of guilt and&lt;br /&gt;
confusion, at the sight of his accusers. –&lt;br /&gt;
Had I said, –I had seen CARNELL offer-&lt;br /&gt;
Ing violence to EMILIA; had rescued her&lt;br /&gt;
from his grasp; had seen him in my&lt;br /&gt;
brother’s chamber armed with a dagger,&lt;br /&gt;
at midnight &amp;amp;c. would my tale have&lt;br /&gt;
been credited? No, I had no proofs to&lt;br /&gt;
offer; I had informed no person, not&lt;br /&gt;
even my brother of what I had seen. I&lt;br /&gt;
believed all attempts at defence would&lt;br /&gt;
prove entirely useless, and therefore for-&lt;br /&gt;
bore to make any. I thought it better to&lt;br /&gt;
meet my fate, dreadful and ignominious&lt;br /&gt;
as it was, with manly firmness and un-&lt;br /&gt;
yielding fortitude; my story would be&lt;br /&gt;
treated as the last effort of despairing&lt;br /&gt;
villainy and impotent malice. The&lt;br /&gt;
Judge addressed the jury in a solemn&lt;br /&gt;
and impressive manner; they retired,&lt;br /&gt;
and in a short time, returned with the ex-&lt;br /&gt;
pected virdict[^4], “&lt;em&gt;guilty!”&lt;/em&gt; They had&lt;br /&gt;
done their duty. I had no cause to com-&lt;br /&gt;
plain, the evidence was sufficient to con-&lt;br /&gt;
demn me; and had I been appointed to&lt;br /&gt;
judge a similar cause I should have act-&lt;br /&gt;
ed in the same manner; I listened to my&lt;br /&gt;
sentence with calmness and composure,&lt;br /&gt;
and was reconducted for the last time,&lt;br /&gt;
to the prison. Thus, I had given you&lt;br /&gt;
a faithful and exact account of my adven-&lt;br /&gt;
tures. – I shall now shortly suffer an ig-&lt;br /&gt;
nominious death: the world in general&lt;br /&gt;
believe me guilty: but the time may&lt;br /&gt;
come, when what is now hidden from hu-&lt;br /&gt;
man eyes, will be disclosed, – and then,&lt;br /&gt;
my friend, when the grave shall hide me&lt;br /&gt;
from the world, you, I trust, will do jus-&lt;br /&gt;
tice to my memory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THUS ended the story of this unfor-&lt;br /&gt;
tunate young man, it was told with the&lt;br /&gt;
greatest apparent sincerity, and my heart&lt;br /&gt;
became deeply interested in his fate. I&lt;br /&gt;
was astonished at the calmness with&lt;br /&gt;
which he supported his misfortunes; he&lt;br /&gt;
was endowed with the keenest sensibili-&lt;br /&gt;
ty, and even timidity of disposition; his&lt;br /&gt;
courage had probably never been awak-&lt;br /&gt;
ened by danger, or perhaps was of that&lt;br /&gt;
kind, which, though unequal to the en-&lt;br /&gt;
counter of sudden and alarming attacks,&lt;br /&gt;
gathered strength by reflection; those&lt;br /&gt;
who best know the various shades of&lt;br /&gt;
character which distinguished mankind,&lt;br /&gt;
know, that there are persons of weak and&lt;br /&gt;
delicate constitutions, who tremble at the&lt;br /&gt;
slightest agitation, while their minds re-&lt;br /&gt;
main firm and undaunted, who, if they&lt;br /&gt;
have time for reflection, meet danger&lt;br /&gt;
with an undaunted front: Thus it ap-&lt;br /&gt;
peared in the present case, here reflection&lt;br /&gt;
seemed to have inspired a contempt of&lt;br /&gt;
death in its most terrified and disgraceful&lt;br /&gt;
form, in the mind of this young man;&lt;br /&gt;
yet there were moments, when his tran-&lt;br /&gt;
quility was disturbed, when the images&lt;br /&gt;
of his father, his friends, and above all,&lt;br /&gt;
his EMILIA presented themselves to&lt;br /&gt;
his imagination: EMILIA loved him with the&lt;br /&gt;
tenderest affection, which even his mis-&lt;br /&gt;
fortunes, (for she believed him guiltless)&lt;br /&gt;
were unable to alienate; yet, for him she&lt;br /&gt;
was doomed to suffer all the evils, flow-&lt;br /&gt;
ing from disappointed love, and the cru-&lt;br /&gt;
el taunts of a misjudging world; these&lt;br /&gt;
causes interrupted his quiet far more&lt;br /&gt;
than his own misfortunes; “my pain,”&lt;br /&gt;
said he will “shortly end; death will&lt;br /&gt;
lull it to rest; but, for them, an ample&lt;br /&gt;
store of anguish is collected, which time&lt;br /&gt;
alone can mitigate.” – Some pressing af-&lt;br /&gt;
fairs obliging me to hasten to Europe, I&lt;br /&gt;
bade him an eternal &lt;em&gt;adieu!&lt;/em&gt; The day of his&lt;br /&gt;
execution was at hand, which my depar-&lt;br /&gt;
ture alone spared me the pain of witness-&lt;br /&gt;
ing. –&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(to be continued)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ 5. 12 May 1804]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOME years after, I returned to&lt;br /&gt;
Philadelphia; the misfortunes of SAUN-&lt;br /&gt;
DERS, though not forgotten, yet the im-&lt;br /&gt;
pression they made was partly effaced&lt;br /&gt;
by time and various cares.&lt;br /&gt;
While walking one day in front-street,&lt;br /&gt;
I was transported with the sight of SAUN-&lt;br /&gt;
DERS coming towards me: we instantly&lt;br /&gt;
recognized each other, and were folded&lt;br /&gt;
in a mutual embrace; I eagerly interro-&lt;br /&gt;
gated him on that subject, which my for-&lt;br /&gt;
mer knowledge of him and my astonish-&lt;br /&gt;
ment at our present meeting naturally&lt;br /&gt;
excited, when, after entering his house,&lt;br /&gt;
he gave me the following information.&lt;br /&gt;
“The day of my intended execution&lt;br /&gt;
came, and with it my father: His pre-&lt;br /&gt;
sence was more distressing to me, than&lt;br /&gt;
death itself; I wished to spare him the&lt;br /&gt;
pangs a parent must feel, who is doomed&lt;br /&gt;
to witness the ignominious death of a&lt;br /&gt;
son, once dear to his affections: but fate&lt;br /&gt;
had determined otherwise: Some per-&lt;br /&gt;
son had informed him to my expected&lt;br /&gt;
fate, and he hastened to bid me a last&lt;br /&gt;
adieu. He entered my prison, I flew to&lt;br /&gt;
embrace him, he received me with emo-&lt;br /&gt;
tions, which his love of justice had made him&lt;br /&gt;
desirous of suppressing; but the tide of&lt;br /&gt;
nature was powerful, and the severity of&lt;br /&gt;
judge was softened by the tenderness&lt;br /&gt;
of the parent: Think, my friend, what&lt;br /&gt;
must be the feelings of a parent who has&lt;br /&gt;
labored for years to teach his offspring&lt;br /&gt;
the duties of life, and the exercise of vir-&lt;br /&gt;
tue, – a parent, venerable for his age,&lt;br /&gt;
and whose life, was unstained with a&lt;br /&gt;
crime, when he beholds the object of his&lt;br /&gt;
love, forsake the paths of rectitude, and&lt;br /&gt;
become the most detested villain, and&lt;br /&gt;
your imagination will paint this scene,&lt;br /&gt;
better than my words can describe it:&lt;br /&gt;
He believed me guilty, – this impression&lt;br /&gt;
I strove to remove, and succeeded:&lt;br /&gt;
falsehood was so mean a crime, that he&lt;br /&gt;
believed me incapable of it, though pas-&lt;br /&gt;
sion might have impelled to the perpetra-&lt;br /&gt;
tion of greater crimes. Yet the convic-&lt;br /&gt;
tion of my innocence did not dispel his&lt;br /&gt;
sorrow; to the pain which the death of a&lt;br /&gt;
son will naturally produce, was added, t&lt;br /&gt;
he shameful manner by which justice in-&lt;br /&gt;
flicted the blow: I should die innocent,&lt;br /&gt;
but would his conviction of this, induce&lt;br /&gt;
the world to believe me so? – Would not&lt;br /&gt;
my death load my family with shame&lt;br /&gt;
and infamy, which an indiscriminating&lt;br /&gt;
world casts on the relations of a murder&lt;br /&gt;
er? – But now the appointed hour was&lt;br /&gt;
come – I bade my friends farewell! and&lt;br /&gt;
the cart moved towards the place of ex-&lt;br /&gt;
ecution; the rope was fastened around&lt;br /&gt;
my neck, the cap was about to be drawn&lt;br /&gt;
over my eyes, and the signal was about&lt;br /&gt;
to be given, the execution of which&lt;br /&gt;
would hide the world from my view for-&lt;br /&gt;
ever, when a sudden and piercing cry of&lt;br /&gt;
“Save him! save him!” was heard and&lt;br /&gt;
a young woman rushed through the&lt;br /&gt;
crowd, to the foot of the gallows; her&lt;br /&gt;
distress and agitation soon discovered&lt;br /&gt;
who she was, it was her for whose mur-&lt;br /&gt;
der I was about to suffer! whom I&lt;br /&gt;
thought I had seen perish on the memo-&lt;br /&gt;
rable night when I left my paternal&lt;br /&gt;
abode! Yet, here she was, by some&lt;br /&gt;
means unaccountable to me, at the foot&lt;br /&gt;
of the gallows, accusing herself as being &lt;br /&gt;
the cause of my misfortunes, and implore-&lt;br /&gt;
ing the sheriff to suspend my execution.&lt;br /&gt;
The crowd pressed tumultuously around,&lt;br /&gt;
and joined their cries to hers. –The&lt;br /&gt;
rope was unfastened, and I reconducted&lt;br /&gt;
to prison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I had been saved, in the last moment,&lt;br /&gt;
from an infamous death; a prospect of&lt;br /&gt;
life and liberty was open before me;&lt;br /&gt;
my friends and even the spectators con-&lt;br /&gt;
gratulated me with that tenderness and&lt;br /&gt;
joy which will naturally arise in the bo-&lt;br /&gt;
soms of men, when they behold inno-&lt;br /&gt;
cence snatched from the fate which is&lt;br /&gt;
only the punishment of guilt; yet,&lt;br /&gt;
strange as it may seem, I was the only&lt;br /&gt;
one who seemed to feel but little emo-&lt;br /&gt;
tion: I had long contemplated death as&lt;br /&gt;
certain and inevitable, I had prepared&lt;br /&gt;
myself to meet it with a manly fortitude;&lt;br /&gt;
I wished to prove with what dignity I&lt;br /&gt;
could suffer a fate I had never merited,&lt;br /&gt;
and conscious innocence brightened my&lt;br /&gt;
prospect of eternity; the name of death&lt;br /&gt;
had become familiar and his terrible&lt;br /&gt;
shaft had lost the keenness of its point;&lt;br /&gt;
I returned to prison with but little more&lt;br /&gt;
pleasure than I left it, and some hours&lt;br /&gt;
elapsed ere I was sufficiently sensible of&lt;br /&gt;
the blessing of renewed existence to be&lt;br /&gt;
grateful for the gift; to no one was my&lt;br /&gt;
life more gratifying than the lovely&lt;br /&gt;
EMILIA; her joy was not expressed by&lt;br /&gt;
words, nor displayed by gestures; but&lt;br /&gt;
was painted in lively colors on her ex-&lt;br /&gt;
pressive countenance; a sweet satisfaction&lt;br /&gt;
animated every feature, and gave addi-&lt;br /&gt;
tional lustre to her beaming eyes.&lt;br /&gt;
“You will naturally be anxious to&lt;br /&gt;
know how this change was produced;&lt;br /&gt;
WARFIELD’S information was as fol-&lt;br /&gt;
lows; she had, for some reason she did&lt;br /&gt;
not explain, determined to anticipate the&lt;br /&gt;
hand of death by drowning herself; that&lt;br /&gt;
she attempted it, you know; but the fear&lt;br /&gt;
of death, proved stronger than her dis-&lt;br /&gt;
gust of life, and with great difficulty she&lt;br /&gt;
saved herself from that fate she had&lt;br /&gt;
sought with so much secresy; but,&lt;br /&gt;
dreading to return home and endure the&lt;br /&gt;
severity of her parents’ reproaches (who&lt;br /&gt;
she supposed would be made acquainted&lt;br /&gt;
with the circumstance) she fled to a rela-&lt;br /&gt;
tion in Maryland: Meanwhile the intel-&lt;br /&gt;
ligence of my fate reached her; alarmed&lt;br /&gt;
at the consequences her folly was likely&lt;br /&gt;
to occasion, she hastened to Philadel-&lt;br /&gt;
phia, thinking it probable she might ar-&lt;br /&gt;
rive in time to avert the fate which hung&lt;br /&gt;
over me; when she reached the city,&lt;br /&gt;
she saw the immense concourse of peo-&lt;br /&gt;
ple, who had assembled to witness my&lt;br /&gt;
execution; curiosity led her to enquire&lt;br /&gt;
my crime; the moment was propitious,&lt;br /&gt;
and my life was preserved. Yet reflec-&lt;br /&gt;
tion dissipated a greater part of my joy,&lt;br /&gt;
when I considered my situation,&lt;br /&gt;
my innocence of the crime of murder&lt;br /&gt;
was proved and I should probably be&lt;br /&gt;
liberated in a short time from confine-&lt;br /&gt;
ment; but who was to prove me inno-&lt;br /&gt;
cent of meditated guilt? Would not I&lt;br /&gt;
still be treated as a being dangerous to&lt;br /&gt;
the community? Would the world consi-&lt;br /&gt;
der me as much less guilty than before?&lt;br /&gt;
I should be detested by all mankind, and&lt;br /&gt;
condemned to wander through the world&lt;br /&gt;
like an outcast from human society; I&lt;br /&gt;
was conscious of my innocence, it is&lt;br /&gt;
true; this had supported me at the most&lt;br /&gt;
trying moment of my existence; but&lt;br /&gt;
that proud, unbending spirit I had receiv-&lt;br /&gt;
ed from nature, and which had been&lt;br /&gt;
strengthened by education, recoiled at&lt;br /&gt;
the prospect. I wished to deserve the&lt;br /&gt;
good opinion of all mankind, to command&lt;br /&gt;
respect, though I could not inspire love;&lt;br /&gt;
how then should I be able, when walking&lt;br /&gt;
through the streets of the city, to bear to&lt;br /&gt;
be shunned by all good men, and treated&lt;br /&gt;
as a being with whom no one could safe-&lt;br /&gt;
ly commune; these reflections gave me&lt;br /&gt;
intolerable anguish; I was almost tempt-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to wish I had perished at the hand of&lt;br /&gt;
justice; I should then have slept quietly&lt;br /&gt;
with the dead, the grave would have&lt;br /&gt;
shielded me from the scorn of mankind,&lt;br /&gt;
and insured my tranquility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“By my uneasiness was happily re-&lt;br /&gt;
lieved–on the day succeeding that on&lt;br /&gt;
which my life was saved, I was saved&lt;br /&gt;
from a fate which I considered as little&lt;br /&gt;
better than death, in the following man-&lt;br /&gt;
ner, several of the persons who were wit-&lt;br /&gt;
nesses at my trial visited me in prison,&lt;br /&gt;
one of whom gave me the following wel-&lt;br /&gt;
come information, which I will give you&lt;br /&gt;
in his own words.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(to be continued)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[ 6. 19 May 1804]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“THAT the motives of my con-&lt;br /&gt;
duct, and that of my colleagues may be&lt;br /&gt;
understood, and our innocence of any de-&lt;br /&gt;
sign against your life, or the crime of&lt;br /&gt;
perjury may be proved; I shall relate a&lt;br /&gt;
few circumstances which happened pre-&lt;br /&gt;
vious to your unfortunate journey to Phi-&lt;br /&gt;
ladelphia: Being on a visit of some&lt;br /&gt;
length in the neighborhood of your late&lt;br /&gt;
residence, we happened to stop one even-&lt;br /&gt;
ing at an inn, where we heard a young&lt;br /&gt;
man (who we then thought was you)&lt;br /&gt;
express his intention of effecting the&lt;br /&gt;
death of SUSAN WARFIELD; he said her&lt;br /&gt;
base treatment of him, would justify any&lt;br /&gt;
measures, however violent and sanguina-&lt;br /&gt;
ry; it was such, as no human being,&lt;br /&gt;
however gentle, would suffer to pass,&lt;br /&gt;
without the severest punishment; and fi-&lt;br /&gt;
nally, he said he would effect her destruct-&lt;br /&gt;
tion in any manner whatever; we saw&lt;br /&gt;
him, though we were in the next room,&lt;br /&gt;
through the glazed door; he, I believe,&lt;br /&gt;
was unconscious of our presence: he de-&lt;br /&gt;
clared his intention to his companion,&lt;br /&gt;
while intoxicated with passion and foam-&lt;br /&gt;
ing with rage and fury; the circumstance&lt;br /&gt;
made some impression on our minds;&lt;br /&gt;
but we believed his words proceeded&lt;br /&gt;
from the violence of his passion, and did&lt;br /&gt;
not doubt, but during the paroxysms of&lt;br /&gt;
anger, he had meditated, what when rea-&lt;br /&gt;
son again regulated his conduct, he&lt;br /&gt;
would certainly not execute; for these&lt;br /&gt;
reasons we were silent, until some&lt;br /&gt;
months after; we were accustomed du-&lt;br /&gt;
ring the moon-light summer nights to&lt;br /&gt;
fish for eels in a small stream which&lt;br /&gt;
emptied into the river Susquehanna, the&lt;br /&gt;
situation we usually chose commanded a&lt;br /&gt;
near view of the rocky eminence where&lt;br /&gt;
we could observe all that passed without&lt;br /&gt;
being seen; here we saw you frequent-&lt;br /&gt;
ly arrive, armed with a club in the night;&lt;br /&gt;
near this place WARFIELD usually pass-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the evening with her lover, as his vi-&lt;br /&gt;
sits to her father’s house were forbidden;&lt;br /&gt;
these circumstance, compared with what&lt;br /&gt;
we had witnessed at the inn, excited our&lt;br /&gt;
suspicions, and you were narrowly watch-&lt;br /&gt;
ed; – one night, while pursuing our usu-&lt;br /&gt;
al sport, we saw WARFIELD approach&lt;br /&gt;
you; we saw you rise soon after, rush&lt;br /&gt;
upon, and push her into the river; all&lt;br /&gt;
this was done in a few minutes, nor was&lt;br /&gt;
it in our power, (though in a short&lt;br /&gt;
distance) to prevent, or to save WAR&lt;br /&gt;
FIELD; as to reach you, we should have&lt;br /&gt;
been obliged to take a circuitous rout:&lt;br /&gt;
we therefore watched you, as you had to&lt;br /&gt;
pass very near where we were concealed,&lt;br /&gt;
by the trees, (it should be recollected,&lt;br /&gt;
that we still believed, you was the same&lt;br /&gt;
person we had seen at the inn.) That&lt;br /&gt;
night you absconded, and it was long&lt;br /&gt;
ere our inquiries traced you to Philadel-&lt;br /&gt;
phia. We caused your apprehension&lt;br /&gt;
and conviction. –As we were returning&lt;br /&gt;
home to Maryland (our place of resi-&lt;br /&gt;
dence) we lodged at an inn on the road,&lt;br /&gt;
where, on entering, to our astonishment&lt;br /&gt;
we saw a man sitting in the room, so&lt;br /&gt;
much resembling you, that we were ful-&lt;br /&gt;
ly persuaded you had escaped from pri-&lt;br /&gt;
son; without a moment’s hesitation we&lt;br /&gt;
seized him; his astonishment seemed&lt;br /&gt;
equal to our own; he said he was in&lt;br /&gt;
search of his wife, who had left his house&lt;br /&gt;
in Maryland, and he believed had gone&lt;br /&gt;
to her father’s on the banks of the Sus-&lt;br /&gt;
quehanna; he told his story with appa-&lt;br /&gt;
rent sincerity, and with that confidence&lt;br /&gt;
which innocence, or impudence, only,&lt;br /&gt;
can assume when charged with a crime;&lt;br /&gt;
we gazed on each other in silent wonder;&lt;br /&gt;
with the banks of the Susquehanna we&lt;br /&gt;
were somewhat acquainted; we asked&lt;br /&gt;
him many questions which he readily an-&lt;br /&gt;
swered; but when we charged him with&lt;br /&gt;
the crime for which you were condemn-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to suffer, he replied, if possible, with&lt;br /&gt;
increasing astonishment; SUSAN WAR-&lt;br /&gt;
FIELD is my wife! Not many days have&lt;br /&gt;
elapsed since I saw her; he explain-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to us several circumstances, all which&lt;br /&gt;
filled us with horror and consternation;&lt;br /&gt;
in short, we were made acquainted with&lt;br /&gt;
every circumstance necessary to prove&lt;br /&gt;
your innocence: Judge then, if you can,&lt;br /&gt;
what we felt; we had caused the death&lt;br /&gt;
of a guiltless and deserving man, he had&lt;br /&gt;
been deceived by an unusual resemblance&lt;br /&gt;
between two persons. unknown to each&lt;br /&gt;
other: the day appointed for the exe-&lt;br /&gt;
cution had already passed and you had&lt;br /&gt;
probably been punished for a deed you&lt;br /&gt;
had never committed; but the pangs of&lt;br /&gt;
death, and the extremest tortures were&lt;br /&gt;
bliss compared to the horrible sensations&lt;br /&gt;
we experienced. –Yet there was still a&lt;br /&gt;
possibility of your execution being defer-&lt;br /&gt;
red; this had more than once, been the&lt;br /&gt;
case; the life of a man and our own fu-&lt;br /&gt;
ture peace were at stake, and while there&lt;br /&gt;
was the most distant hope it might be&lt;br /&gt;
saved, it was our duty and our wish to&lt;br /&gt;
make the experiment. To return to Phila-&lt;br /&gt;
delphia and to take CARSON with us,&lt;br /&gt;
was a resolution adopted and instantly&lt;br /&gt;
put into execution; to our inexpressible&lt;br /&gt;
joy our journey has not been vain; you&lt;br /&gt;
will scarcely be able, sufferer as you have&lt;br /&gt;
been, to forgive us, who have been,&lt;br /&gt;
though unintentionally, the cause of your&lt;br /&gt;
misfortunes; but could you know the&lt;br /&gt;
torments we have felt, when in imagina-&lt;br /&gt;
tion, we saw your injured spirit rise from&lt;br /&gt;
the shades of death, and accuse us of des-&lt;br /&gt;
troying you by deeds perpetrated only by&lt;br /&gt;
the most abandoned of mankind, and&lt;br /&gt;
when you have seen the dreadful resem-&lt;br /&gt;
blance which caused our unfortunate er-&lt;br /&gt;
ror; you will look on us with less detest-&lt;br /&gt;
ation than is at present possible.” –&lt;br /&gt;
He ceased, went out, and soon return-&lt;br /&gt;
ed with CARSON––here was indeed an&lt;br /&gt;
extraordinary resemblance, so exact, so&lt;br /&gt;
striking, that all present were filled with&lt;br /&gt;
astonishment: but for a small difference in&lt;br /&gt;
our height, the most intimate friend&lt;br /&gt;
could have scarcely distinguished us&lt;br /&gt;
from each other; from these men I learn-&lt;br /&gt;
ed that the dreadful CARNELL was dead,&lt;br /&gt;
and thus another cause of uneasiness was&lt;br /&gt;
removed. I was now soon liberated, re-&lt;br /&gt;
stored to that respect I had before enjoy-&lt;br /&gt;
ed, and united to that amiable woman,&lt;br /&gt;
EMILIA, who had been one of the first&lt;br /&gt;
causes of my misfortunes. In her I have&lt;br /&gt;
found a woman of a superior understand-&lt;br /&gt;
ing, enlightened mind, gentle dispo-&lt;br /&gt;
sition, her superior judgment has correct-&lt;br /&gt;
ed many of my errors; she has lessen-&lt;br /&gt;
ed that love of distinction and celebrity,&lt;br /&gt;
which I had once indulged, and which I&lt;br /&gt;
had attained by means, as unwelcome,&lt;br /&gt;
as unexpected; she has convinced me,&lt;br /&gt;
that fame is not always the portion of&lt;br /&gt;
merit, that to deserve the esteem of man-&lt;br /&gt;
kind, was a superior enjoyment to an en-&lt;br /&gt;
larged mind, than distinction or fame&lt;br /&gt;
could bestow. “&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preface&quot;&gt;Preface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Albert and Eliza,&lt;/em&gt; a novel written by Isaac Mitchell, was serialized in the &lt;em&gt;Political Barometer&lt;/em&gt;, a New York newspaper. Its first installment appeared on June 8, 1802, and it was published weekly until July 13, 1802. The author Mitchell not only wrote novels in the &lt;em&gt;Political Barometer&lt;/em&gt; but was also the editor and publisher. Born near Albany, New York in 1759, he joined the newspaper business in 1798 in Poughkeepsie, New York. Though Mitchell worked with several newspapers, he was involved with the &lt;em&gt;Political Barometer&lt;/em&gt; for the longest time from 1802 to 1806. The &lt;em&gt;Political Barometer&lt;/em&gt;, a Poughkeepsie, New York weekly newspaper, was first named &lt;em&gt;The Guardian&lt;/em&gt; when Jesse Buel and Nathaniel Joyner started the paper. The paper was an open advocate of Thomas Jefferson. When Mitchell, purchased Joyner’s interest in 1802 the paper was renamed to &lt;em&gt;Political Barometer&lt;/em&gt;. By May of 1805, Buell’s name was removed as publisher and editor and Mitchell remained the sole proprietor of the newspaper, until 1806.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In its first publication on June 8, 1802, Mitchell and Buel state that the paper aims to incorporate both domestic and international materials and claims it is open to political discussion from either Federalist or Democratic-Republican parties. However, it was clear that Mitchell and &lt;em&gt;Political Barometer&lt;/em&gt; was more in the favor of the Republicans. On September 16, 1806, Mitchell published his farewell editorial in his the &lt;em&gt;Political Barometer&lt;/em&gt;. Within this farewell address, Mitchell stressed the important role that he and his newspaper played within the current political climate. As a fervent supporter of Republicanism, for Mitchell, nothing was more important and nothing was more vital than preserving his political party’s influence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although Mitchell went on to work as a newspaperman at other journals, it is during his time at the &lt;em&gt;Political Barometer&lt;/em&gt; that his most popular works of literature were produced. In addition to &lt;em&gt;Albert and Eliza&lt;/em&gt;, Mitchell also wrote and published two other longer novels: &lt;em&gt;Melville and Phalez&lt;/em&gt; (1803), and &lt;em&gt;Alonzo and Melissa&lt;/em&gt; (1804). Mitchell died from Typhus on November 26, 1812 and is buried in the Dutch Church Cemetery in Poughkeepsie, New York, next to his wife, Anah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mitchell’s three novels, &lt;em&gt;Albert and Eliza&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Melville and Phalex&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Alonzo and Melissa&lt;/em&gt;, were serialized and published in the &lt;em&gt;Political Barometer&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Alonzo and Melissa&lt;/em&gt; was later edited and published in a book with the title &lt;em&gt;The Asylum&lt;/em&gt; in 1811 and now has become his most known novel&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt; Aside from Mitchell’s editing and re-publication of &lt;em&gt;The Asylum&lt;/em&gt;, his three novels at times have been ascribed to other authors. &lt;em&gt;Albert and Eliza&lt;/em&gt;, for example, was pirated by Russel Ladd and was reprinted as a book in 1802. This was due to the common practice of literary piracy that took place in the early American republic. It is clear, however, from a note to his work &lt;em&gt;Albert and Eliza&lt;/em&gt; that he is indeed the original author of all three &lt;em&gt;Political Barometer&lt;/em&gt; works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As with other serialized works, &lt;em&gt;Albert and Eliza&lt;/em&gt; is also composed with complex subplots. The main story is about a young woman named Eliza’s fidelity and faithfulness to her betrothed Albert. Compared to the topics surrounding Albert and Eliza, such as fidelity, sentiment, and virtue, other characters raise rather proactive issues. For example, when it is revealed at the end of the novel that Blake, one of Eliza’s admirers, had married Ms. Smith without knowing the fact that she was actually his half-sister or when Blake kills his half-brother Palmer in a duel raise the issue of incest and fratricide. Along with the complex subplots, the lapses between each installment create curiosity and anticipation of the next story which is another feature of serialization. Whereas book readers can jump right into the ending, serialization creates terms between each episode and extends the reading experience to readers. &lt;em&gt;Albert and Eliza&lt;/em&gt; also has intentional breaks between installments that heighten the tension in the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALBERT AND ELIZA.–A TALE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[1. 8 June 1802]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The public are assured that the principal incidents *&lt;br /&gt;
*in the following story are literally true. They *&lt;br /&gt;
*were transacted more than one hundred years *&lt;br /&gt;
*ago, and have never before appeared in print.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
IN the early settlement of North-America, the&lt;br /&gt;
only son of a gentleman of Long-Island, de-&lt;br /&gt;
voted his addresses to a young lady of his neigh&lt;br /&gt;
bourhood, and as no unpropitious impediment op-&lt;br /&gt;
posed their union, the marriage day was appoint-&lt;br /&gt;
ed under the most flattering auspices. Previous,&lt;br /&gt;
however, to the consummation of that event, the&lt;br /&gt;
father of the young man received advice from&lt;br /&gt;
England, his native place, that by the death of&lt;br /&gt;
one of his predecessors he became rightful&lt;br /&gt;
heir to a considerable inheritance, and that he&lt;br /&gt;
himself, or some immediate branch of this fami-&lt;br /&gt;
ly, should appear to substantiate the claim. As&lt;br /&gt;
the old gentleman was considerably advanced in&lt;br /&gt;
age, and his health in decay, it was concluded to&lt;br /&gt;
send his son, whose name was Albert, and that&lt;br /&gt;
his marriage should be suspended until his return.&lt;br /&gt;
This was a heavy stroke to the young lovers, but&lt;br /&gt;
as the circumstance was indispensable, they sub-&lt;br /&gt;
mitted to the decision, and Albert immediately&lt;br /&gt;
prepared for his voyage, expecting to return in a-&lt;br /&gt;
bout one year. The parting scene was of the&lt;br /&gt;
most tender nature; but with the greatest confi-&lt;br /&gt;
dence in each other’s fidelity, they looked for-&lt;br /&gt;
ward to the time when they should, happily, a-&lt;br /&gt;
gain meet, and all past sorrows be lost in days of&lt;br /&gt;
uninterrupted felicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Albert took his departure for England, and&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza (the name of the lady) from Montauk-&lt;br /&gt;
Point, pursued the ship with her eyes, until it&lt;br /&gt;
mingled with the blue glimmer of distance, and,&lt;br /&gt;
lessening, gradually receded, first the hulk, then&lt;br /&gt;
the sails, till at last the whole was totally lost&lt;br /&gt;
beneath the convexity of the billowy main. She&lt;br /&gt;
stood a long time anxiously gazing at the place&lt;br /&gt;
where the ship disappeared, and at length pen-&lt;br /&gt;
sively returned to her father’s house.&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza was a girl, whose feelings were alive to&lt;br /&gt;
all the refinements of sensibily. In her present&lt;br /&gt;
situation, therefore, melancholy superceded her&lt;br /&gt;
high-wrought expectations of happiness, which&lt;br /&gt;
manifested itself in gloomy manners and rigid se-&lt;br /&gt;
clusion. She would frequently wander along the&lt;br /&gt;
shores of Montauk, and from its extremest point,&lt;br /&gt;
would rivet her eyes to that distant part of the&lt;br /&gt;
ocean where the ship which bore her Albert a-&lt;br /&gt;
way was lost to her view. Here fancy presented&lt;br /&gt;
innumerable barriers to the completion of her&lt;br /&gt;
hopes. Perhaps the ship in which Albert sailed&lt;br /&gt;
was already buried in the waves. Perhaps the&lt;br /&gt;
fatigues of the sea, or some deleterious fever had&lt;br /&gt;
forever closed the eyes of him she loved. Or,&lt;br /&gt;
perhaps, absence and the charms of some trans-&lt;br /&gt;
atlantic beauty might dissever his attachment&lt;br /&gt;
from the maid of his vows, and bind them to more&lt;br /&gt;
advantageous prospects. These reflections tend-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to sink her still deeper in dejection. Her&lt;br /&gt;
health became impaired, and her friends, after&lt;br /&gt;
vainly attempting to arouse her attention to visi-&lt;br /&gt;
ble and cheerful objects, resolved to send her to&lt;br /&gt;
reside awhile at the city of New-York, with her&lt;br /&gt;
father’s brother, hoping that change of situation&lt;br /&gt;
might produce a change of ideas, and she again&lt;br /&gt;
be induced to realize the blessings of society. To&lt;br /&gt;
this arrangement she consented, more out of&lt;br /&gt;
complaisance to the solicitations of her friends,&lt;br /&gt;
than from her own choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At New-York, objects widely different from&lt;br /&gt;
any which Eliza had before experienced, present-&lt;br /&gt;
ed themselves, which, in some measure, a-&lt;br /&gt;
woke her from the stupor of thought. She had&lt;br /&gt;
never, before, seen the gay and busy world. So&lt;br /&gt;
sudden a removal from the scenes of rural simplicity,&lt;br /&gt;
to the theatre of active and brilliant life, could&lt;br /&gt;
not fail to illuminate the dark mists of sad-&lt;br /&gt;
ness, which, by degrees, gave place to more lu-&lt;br /&gt;
cid ideas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were no stage-representations in New-&lt;br /&gt;
York, at this early period; but there were fashi-&lt;br /&gt;
onable amusements, and polite company. To&lt;br /&gt;
these was Eliza frequently introduced, and every&lt;br /&gt;
effort was made, by her new acquaintance, to ren-&lt;br /&gt;
der her situation pleasing and interesting. Her&lt;br /&gt;
uncle was one of the settlers who came over from&lt;br /&gt;
England with a splendid fortune, and classed&lt;br /&gt;
with the first characters in the city; consequent-&lt;br /&gt;
ly the best company resorted to his house. He&lt;br /&gt;
had a daughter of about the same age with Eli-&lt;br /&gt;
za, and a son somewhat older. Nothing was&lt;br /&gt;
wanting, on their part, to promote the happiness&lt;br /&gt;
of their friend, and by all the visitors she was&lt;br /&gt;
held in the highest consideration. Her bosom&lt;br /&gt;
felt the pleasing power of social reciprocity, and&lt;br /&gt;
the discordant thrill of anguish more feebly vi-&lt;br /&gt;
brated the chords of affection. While she wan-&lt;br /&gt;
dered along the margin of the shore, and beheld&lt;br /&gt;
the distant approaching sails, as they dimly ap-&lt;br /&gt;
peared to rise out of the farthest verge of the o-&lt;br /&gt;
cean, she breathed a sigh to the remembrance of&lt;br /&gt;
former joys, fondly anticipated a speedy return&lt;br /&gt;
of those happy hours, which would effectually&lt;br /&gt;
obliterate every vestige of former care and anxie-&lt;br /&gt;
ty, and became tranquil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(To be continued.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2. 15 June 1802]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMONG those who visited at the house of&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza’s uncle, was a young man of&lt;br /&gt;
the name of Blake, who was nephew to the Go-&lt;br /&gt;
vernor of the province. Pleased with the man-&lt;br /&gt;
ners and appearance of Eliza, he frequently at-&lt;br /&gt;
tended her in public, and sometimes in com-&lt;br /&gt;
pany, only, of her cousins. He experienced, or&lt;br /&gt;
fancied he experienced, greater happiness when&lt;br /&gt;
in her presence, than he could any where else en-&lt;br /&gt;
joy, and he became a more constant visitor to&lt;br /&gt;
the family.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake was considerably older than Eliza. He&lt;br /&gt;
had seen some gay days in England, which place&lt;br /&gt;
he had left soon after the death of his father, by&lt;br /&gt;
whose will he became possessed of an ample for-&lt;br /&gt;
tune, and came over to America with his kins-&lt;br /&gt;
man on his appointment to the supreme magis-&lt;br /&gt;
tracy of the colony. He was a youth of fashion-&lt;br /&gt;
able taste, of easy address, engaging manners,&lt;br /&gt;
and of an agreeable appearance. He was one&lt;br /&gt;
of those characters who are distinguished by the&lt;br /&gt;
appellation of a Lady’s man. He had no idea of&lt;br /&gt;
forming any serious connection with Eliza; but&lt;br /&gt;
he esteemed her innocent gaiety, admired her&lt;br /&gt;
beauty, and was charmed, with those indescriba-&lt;br /&gt;
ble graces, which are ever the attendants of sym-&lt;br /&gt;
metry of form, sincerity of mind, and a vivacious,&lt;br /&gt;
uncontaminated simplicity of manners, Eliza&lt;br /&gt;
received his addresses as he designed them. She&lt;br /&gt;
suffered him to attend her because she was wil-&lt;br /&gt;
ling to be attended by some person of distinction&lt;br /&gt;
whenever she appeared in public; and to visit her&lt;br /&gt;
on account of the respect with which he was&lt;br /&gt;
treated, both in her uncle’s family, and by all&lt;br /&gt;
with whom he was acquainted. Balls were the&lt;br /&gt;
principal amusements, and at these he was, with&lt;br /&gt;
few exceptions, her partner. Her being ushered&lt;br /&gt;
into notice by so conspicuous a character as&lt;br /&gt;
Blake, gave her general eclat among the gentle-&lt;br /&gt;
men, and caused her to become an object of envy&lt;br /&gt;
to some of the ladies. It would be vanity to&lt;br /&gt;
say that such flattering attention did not, in some&lt;br /&gt;
degree, elate the heart of Eliza, for what bosom&lt;br /&gt;
is there which is totally unsusceptible to the fa-&lt;br /&gt;
scinating powers of adulation!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake had been particular to a Miss Smith, a&lt;br /&gt;
lady of distinction in the city, who now became&lt;br /&gt;
neglected, and consequently piqued, by his at-&lt;br /&gt;
tendance upon Eliza. She considered her as a&lt;br /&gt;
rival, and of course became her enemy. Of this,&lt;br /&gt;
however, both her pride and her interest prevent-&lt;br /&gt;
ed her from making an avowal. She put on the&lt;br /&gt;
appearance of the sincerest friendship to Eliza,&lt;br /&gt;
and assiduously participated in her most retired in-&lt;br /&gt;
timacies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fame of Eliza had also raised up a serious&lt;br /&gt;
rival to Blake. A Mr. Palmer, a man of gal-&lt;br /&gt;
lantry, obsequiously bowed to her charms, and&lt;br /&gt;
assiduously strove to ingratiate himself into her fa-&lt;br /&gt;
vor. Blake and he seldom met, unless in pub-&lt;br /&gt;
lic, but Palmer sought every opportunity, in the&lt;br /&gt;
absence of his competitor, to engage her atten-&lt;br /&gt;
tion, and, if possible, diminish the preference&lt;br /&gt;
and esteem which he supposed she entertained for&lt;br /&gt;
Blake; this stimulated the latter to a more vigi-&lt;br /&gt;
lant perseverance; his visits to Eliza became&lt;br /&gt;
more frequent, and his attention more sedulous.&lt;br /&gt;
He waited on her one evening to offer him-&lt;br /&gt;
self as her partner at an approaching ball, and&lt;br /&gt;
found, to his extreme vexation, that her hand&lt;br /&gt;
had been previously engaged to Palmer. He&lt;br /&gt;
did not remonstrate; this would have been im-&lt;br /&gt;
proper; besides, he could claim no privilege so&lt;br /&gt;
to do. He soon took leave and withdrew, in&lt;br /&gt;
chagrin and disappointment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the assembly Blake danced with Miss Smith,&lt;br /&gt;
but his spirits were sunk, and his natural vivaci-&lt;br /&gt;
ty depressed. On this he was rallied, and he&lt;br /&gt;
complained of an indisposition. Miss Smith and&lt;br /&gt;
Palmer well knew what antidote would have re-&lt;br /&gt;
moved the malady.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day he seriously consulted his situa-&lt;br /&gt;
tion. He found himself under the controul of&lt;br /&gt;
an unconquerable passion; a passion which, like&lt;br /&gt;
the electric fluid, finds no restraint but in the ob-&lt;br /&gt;
ject of its attraction, or in its own dissolution.&lt;br /&gt;
What was to be done? Was not she who had&lt;br /&gt;
raised this tempest in his bosom worthy of honor-&lt;br /&gt;
able proposals? Was it not probable she would&lt;br /&gt;
accept them if made then in an honorable way?–&lt;br /&gt;
Blake new nothing of Albert, or of her being&lt;br /&gt;
under any prior engagements. But were there&lt;br /&gt;
no other barriers to a union with Eliza? There&lt;br /&gt;
were, and serious ones too.–Barriers which none&lt;br /&gt;
except himself and one other person were acquaint-&lt;br /&gt;
ted with, on this side of the Atlantic. Were these&lt;br /&gt;
impediments insurmountable? Could they not be&lt;br /&gt;
removed? No plan which had hitherto presented&lt;br /&gt;
itself, appeared of sufficient validity to enable&lt;br /&gt;
him to surmount the obstacle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the pressure of these reflections, he wan-&lt;br /&gt;
dered, when evening came, along the banks of&lt;br /&gt;
the Hudson, above the city, where the elms and&lt;br /&gt;
the willows, on the verge of the river, cast a&lt;br /&gt;
dun, umbrageous shade. The Sun was retiring&lt;br /&gt;
behind the blue western hills, while the brazen&lt;br /&gt;
summits of the steepled fanes, alone, held the last&lt;br /&gt;
gleam of his reluctant ray. “The breeze’s rust-&lt;br /&gt;
ling wing was in the tree,” and the faintly mur-&lt;br /&gt;
muring wave dashed in melancholy cadence upon&lt;br /&gt;
the pebbly shore. Twilight gathered around,&lt;br /&gt;
when he heard voices and footsteps approaching.&lt;br /&gt;
They came on–it was Eliza and her cousins,&lt;br /&gt;
who were returning from participating the beau-&lt;br /&gt;
ties of nature in an evening walk. He joined them,&lt;br /&gt;
and the gloom which hovered about his mind&lt;br /&gt;
was, in some measure, dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As they moved slowly on towards home, the&lt;br /&gt;
company walked on, and Eliza and Blake were&lt;br /&gt;
left together. She observed that an unusual pen-&lt;br /&gt;
siveness hung about him, and gaily enquired the&lt;br /&gt;
occasion. This presented a fair opportunity for&lt;br /&gt;
an ecclaircissement. The before mentioned obsta-&lt;br /&gt;
cles rushed across his mind, but Eliza was pre-&lt;br /&gt;
sent, and the consequences vanished. He, there-&lt;br /&gt;
fore, freely disclosed his situation, as it respected&lt;br /&gt;
her; told her that in attending to her from com-&lt;br /&gt;
plaisance, his happiness had become seriously in-&lt;br /&gt;
terested. That on her determination all his fu-&lt;br /&gt;
ture prospects rested; and that if her feelings&lt;br /&gt;
did not forbid a reciprocal return of affection, he&lt;br /&gt;
stood ready to proffer her his hand and his heart.&lt;br /&gt;
Had a peal of thunder burst, in sheeted flame,&lt;br /&gt;
from the heavens, it would not have shocked E-&lt;br /&gt;
liza more than did this solemn declaration. She&lt;br /&gt;
had never considered any attention which she had&lt;br /&gt;
received from the gentleman, other than the offi-&lt;br /&gt;
cious, refined politeness, which is common to the&lt;br /&gt;
superior walks of life. She had esteemed Blake&lt;br /&gt;
as her friend, but never thought of him as a sui-&lt;br /&gt;
tor; and although she was pleased with him as&lt;br /&gt;
an obsequious gallant, yet when set in compari-&lt;br /&gt;
son with Albert, whose likeness still glowed upon&lt;br /&gt;
her heart in as lively colours as ever, he sunk&lt;br /&gt;
into deformity. She wished not to realize the&lt;br /&gt;
idea that any person except Albert should enter-&lt;br /&gt;
tain, for her, a more exalted sentiment than that&lt;br /&gt;
of friendship and esteem. To the professions of&lt;br /&gt;
Blake, therefore, she could make no answer,&lt;br /&gt;
which, had she attempted, her sensations would&lt;br /&gt;
have choked her utterance. She hastily with-&lt;br /&gt;
drew her hand, which he made but a feeble effort&lt;br /&gt;
to detain, quickened her step and soon overtook&lt;br /&gt;
the company. Blake attended her to her uncle’s&lt;br /&gt;
door; as he withdrew he whispered her, “am I&lt;br /&gt;
to receive no answer?’’ She hesitated, and then&lt;br /&gt;
with vehemence replied, “Sir, it is impossible,’’&lt;br /&gt;
and immediately retired to her chamber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(To be continued.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3. 22 June 1802]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ELIZA flung herself upon her bed, but with-&lt;br /&gt;
out any inclination to sleep. Her spirits&lt;br /&gt;
had been agitated, and it required time to com-&lt;br /&gt;
pose them. She saw herself in a dangerous situ-&lt;br /&gt;
ation. If Blake was sincere, which she had no&lt;br /&gt;
reason to doubt, when comparing his conduct&lt;br /&gt;
with his declaration, she knew not to what&lt;br /&gt;
lengths the matter might be carried, nor how&lt;br /&gt;
deeply she might be involved in the consequen-&lt;br /&gt;
ces. She therefore resolved to write to her fa-&lt;br /&gt;
ther, desiring him to send for her home; this de-&lt;br /&gt;
termination gave some relief to her mind, she&lt;br /&gt;
became less restless, and at last fell asleep.&lt;br /&gt;
In the morning she was roused by her aunt,&lt;br /&gt;
who brought her a letter which the carrier had&lt;br /&gt;
just handed in; as soon as she fixed her eye up-&lt;br /&gt;
on the superscription, she knew it to be from Al-&lt;br /&gt;
bert. She broke the seal and found it contained&lt;br /&gt;
the particulars of his voyage to England, and&lt;br /&gt;
the kind reception he met with from the friends&lt;br /&gt;
of his father’s house. His business was nearly&lt;br /&gt;
completed, and he expected in about three months&lt;br /&gt;
from the date of his letter, to set sail for Ameri-&lt;br /&gt;
ca. This letter had been written upwards of&lt;br /&gt;
two months, and was dated nine months after&lt;br /&gt;
he left America, so that the time was nearly ar-&lt;br /&gt;
rived when he was to leave England. Albert, in&lt;br /&gt;
his letter, had breathed out the tenderness of his&lt;br /&gt;
soul to Eliza, lamented their long absence, and&lt;br /&gt;
the wide distance which separated them, and fi-&lt;br /&gt;
nally, pourtrayed in vivid colorings the joys of&lt;br /&gt;
their expected meeting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This letter banished almost every trace of sor-&lt;br /&gt;
row from the bosom of Eliza. She considered&lt;br /&gt;
the affair of Blake, and was surprised that it&lt;br /&gt;
gave her so much anxiety. He had compliment-&lt;br /&gt;
ed her charms–this was not uncommon. –She&lt;br /&gt;
believed him to be actuated by generous princi-&lt;br /&gt;
ples, and that if he understood her situation, he&lt;br /&gt;
would withdraw his attention. She therefore&lt;br /&gt;
resolved, whenever a proper occasion should of-&lt;br /&gt;
fer to give him some intimation which might&lt;br /&gt;
deter him from continuing his addresses. This,&lt;br /&gt;
however, did not prevent her from writing a re-&lt;br /&gt;
quest to her father to permit her to return home.&lt;br /&gt;
Quite different were the feelings of Blake.–&lt;br /&gt;
He had been repulsed where he had the most san-&lt;br /&gt;
guine hopes of success. He had, hitherto, supposed&lt;br /&gt;
himself not disagreeable to Eliza. Had he not oc-&lt;br /&gt;
casion to believe she held him in preference? –&lt;br /&gt;
What then could be the cause of her sudden a-&lt;br /&gt;
larm, and seeming disgust at his proposals? No-&lt;br /&gt;
thing appeared more probable than that some o-&lt;br /&gt;
ther person had, recently, secured her affections,&lt;br /&gt;
and this person could be no other than Palmer.&lt;br /&gt;
This conclusion pierced his soul–Among all the&lt;br /&gt;
embarrassments in love, none strike so deep–&lt;br /&gt;
none wound so keenly, as the idea of a rival.&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza’s reply on Blake’s pressing for an answer,&lt;br /&gt;
was, “it is impossible.” But what was &lt;em&gt;impos-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;sible?&lt;/em&gt; Was it impossible that she could then&lt;br /&gt;
come to a determination? or that she could ac-&lt;br /&gt;
cede to his proposals? The former he wished to&lt;br /&gt;
hope; the latter he had great reason to fear.&lt;br /&gt;
To extricate himself from the torture of sus-&lt;br /&gt;
pense, he determined to see her that day, and, if&lt;br /&gt;
possible to bring her to a decision. As he en-&lt;br /&gt;
tered the door of her uncle’s house, he met Pal-&lt;br /&gt;
mer, who had been to invite Eliza to ride out&lt;br /&gt;
with him on the following day. They bowed to&lt;br /&gt;
each other with distant civility, and Blake was&lt;br /&gt;
admitted into Eliza’s room, who happened to be&lt;br /&gt;
alone. As he entered, an involuntary tremor&lt;br /&gt;
seized her; but it was momentary; with her usu-&lt;br /&gt;
al cheerfulness, she desired him to be seated, and&lt;br /&gt;
his confidence, which had forsaken him as he ap-&lt;br /&gt;
proached the house, returned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake soon introduced the subject he came up-&lt;br /&gt;
on. He asked pardon for the discomposure his&lt;br /&gt;
declaration had thrown her into, the preceding&lt;br /&gt;
evening; but as his happiness depended upon&lt;br /&gt;
the result, he desired her to be explicit. She&lt;br /&gt;
told him that she esteemed him as a friend–&lt;br /&gt;
thanked him for his former complaisance, but&lt;br /&gt;
that both her feelings and her situation forbade&lt;br /&gt;
her to encourage his addresses; that she was ex-&lt;br /&gt;
cited to deal thus frankly, from motives of delica-&lt;br /&gt;
cy to them both, but that she must consider her-&lt;br /&gt;
self excused from any further explanation.&lt;br /&gt;
So ingenuous a decision disconcerted every ar-&lt;br /&gt;
gument which Blake had prepared to enforce his&lt;br /&gt;
suit. His mind became paralyzed and his tongue&lt;br /&gt;
powerless. They both sat silent, and were hap-&lt;br /&gt;
pily relieved from a very embarrassing situation by&lt;br /&gt;
the entrance of company. Blake immediately&lt;br /&gt;
arose to depart; Eliza waited upon him to the&lt;br /&gt;
door; he disconsolately took her hand, bowed,&lt;br /&gt;
and bade her good night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Palmer had not been more particular to Eliza,&lt;br /&gt;
than to several other ladies of the city; conse-&lt;br /&gt;
quently his attention was less to be feared. She&lt;br /&gt;
at first declined his offer to ride out with him,&lt;br /&gt;
the day following, but he solicited, and she fi-&lt;br /&gt;
nally consented. He came at the appointed&lt;br /&gt;
hour, which was about three o’clock in the af-&lt;br /&gt;
ternoon–Eliza was handed into the coach, and&lt;br /&gt;
they drove out towards Kingsbridge. It was&lt;br /&gt;
that season of the year when decaying nature&lt;br /&gt;
was fast sinking to her wintry tomb. As they&lt;br /&gt;
passed along, Eliza was highly interested in the&lt;br /&gt;
picturesque scenes which the landscape exhibit-&lt;br /&gt;
ed. The yellow splendor of the faded foliage;&lt;br /&gt;
the lofty grandeur of the rugged mountain; the&lt;br /&gt;
solitary lapse of the winding stream, as it mur-&lt;br /&gt;
mured along the hollow valley; the rustling&lt;br /&gt;
sound of the lingering gales, as they idly pursu-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the withering leaves over the variegated fields;&lt;br /&gt;
the plaintive melody of the autumnal birds, all&lt;br /&gt;
conspired to thrill her bosom with a pleasing, me-&lt;br /&gt;
lancholy sensation. They passed Kingsbride,&lt;br /&gt;
and drove a little distance into the country, where&lt;br /&gt;
they stopped for refreshment, and loitered away&lt;br /&gt;
the time until evening. As they were about&lt;br /&gt;
to return, they perceived a shower arising.&lt;br /&gt;
They hastened into the carriage, and Palmer or-&lt;br /&gt;
dered the postillion to drive on with speed. They&lt;br /&gt;
passed Kingsbridge, and came very near Haer-&lt;br /&gt;
lem before the shower overtook them. There&lt;br /&gt;
were, then, but few scattering houses in this&lt;br /&gt;
(place, and but one inn of any respectability.)&lt;br /&gt;
Here Palmer proposed to stop, to which, as the&lt;br /&gt;
storm became furious, Eliza agreed. They were&lt;br /&gt;
shown into a decent room; Palmer ordered wine&lt;br /&gt;
and a dish of fruit. The violence of the storm&lt;br /&gt;
did not abate till sometime in the evening. E-&lt;br /&gt;
liza grew very uneasy, particularly as she observ-&lt;br /&gt;
ed that Palmer drank very freely of wine. She in-&lt;br /&gt;
treated that they might proceed: he raised ob-&lt;br /&gt;
jections; the storm had not entirely ceased–&lt;br /&gt;
when it had they could soon reach town. He&lt;br /&gt;
drank more wine, she perceived he became in-&lt;br /&gt;
toxicated, and insisted upon going on immediate-&lt;br /&gt;
ly. He went out as though to give orders for&lt;br /&gt;
the necessary preparations, but soon returning,&lt;br /&gt;
and seating himself beside her, “Dear Eliza,”&lt;br /&gt;
said he, “the postillion is asleep, the evening is&lt;br /&gt;
advanced, the roads are wet and slippery; you&lt;br /&gt;
must content yourself to stay here until morning,&lt;br /&gt;
and then, my blooming charmer, I will, with&lt;br /&gt;
pleasure, convey you to your friends.” Thus&lt;br /&gt;
saying, he clasped her, with ardor, to his breast;&lt;br /&gt;
she screamed for assistance; two men rushed into&lt;br /&gt;
the room and disingaged her–it was the inn-&lt;br /&gt;
keeper and Blake! Palmer attempted to resist&lt;br /&gt;
them, and ordered them to leave the room;&lt;br /&gt;
Blake asked Eliza whether she was detained there&lt;br /&gt;
against her will, she answered that she was; he&lt;br /&gt;
removed her immediately from the room; as&lt;br /&gt;
they were going out, Palmer seized her arm and&lt;br /&gt;
attempted to rescue her, but he was thrust back&lt;br /&gt;
by Blake with so much force that he fell, with&lt;br /&gt;
violence, to the floor. “If you can be found&lt;br /&gt;
to-morrow,” said he to Blake, as he rose up, “I&lt;br /&gt;
shall consider it my duty to acknowledge my ob-&lt;br /&gt;
ligations for this politeness.” “You are not&lt;br /&gt;
unacquainted that I reside at the government&lt;br /&gt;
house,” replied Blake, and Palmer withdrew to&lt;br /&gt;
his room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake engaged the inn-keeper to furnish a ser-&lt;br /&gt;
vant with a horse and chaise, to convey Eliza to&lt;br /&gt;
town. He mounted his horse and rode behind&lt;br /&gt;
until they arrived at her uncle’s; he handed her&lt;br /&gt;
into the door, tenderly bade adieu, and retired&lt;br /&gt;
to his lodging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(To be continued.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[4. 29 June 1802]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PALMER was not a libertine in principle.&lt;br /&gt;
He felt no extraordinary attachment to E-&lt;br /&gt;
liza. He esteemed her as a gay, fashionable and&lt;br /&gt;
lovely girl, but had formed no dishonorable&lt;br /&gt;
designs respecting her. He had not even an in-&lt;br /&gt;
tention of tarrying all night at the inn in Haer-&lt;br /&gt;
lem, when driven thither by the storm; but be-&lt;br /&gt;
ing warmed with wine, which at times, he was&lt;br /&gt;
accustomed to use with too much freedom, added&lt;br /&gt;
to the idea of so enchanting a girl in his posses-&lt;br /&gt;
sion, his senses became perverted, and his reason&lt;br /&gt;
overpowered by the arbitrary influence of passi-&lt;br /&gt;
on. It is not, however, probable that he would&lt;br /&gt;
have proceeded to any indecencies; a repulse&lt;br /&gt;
would have awed him into reverence: but the&lt;br /&gt;
delicate feelings of Eliza, abhorrently alive to&lt;br /&gt;
every appearance of indecorum, could not brook&lt;br /&gt;
an advancement beyond the most strict bounds of&lt;br /&gt;
civility. Blake, under the melancholy burden&lt;br /&gt;
of disappointment, unconscious of the excursion&lt;br /&gt;
of Eliza and Palmer, had rode into the country&lt;br /&gt;
merely for amusement, and on his return had a-&lt;br /&gt;
lighted at the inn, a short time after them. —-&lt;br /&gt;
This accounts for the incidents of Haerlem&lt;br /&gt;
affair.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Blake arose at an early&lt;br /&gt;
hour, determined, as soon as convenience would&lt;br /&gt;
permit, to call at the house of Eliza’s uncle, to&lt;br /&gt;
learn something concerning the affair, of which,&lt;br /&gt;
as yet, he knew but little. He supposed that her&lt;br /&gt;
attachment to Palmer was the principal cause of&lt;br /&gt;
his rejection, and he secretly rejoiced at the pros-&lt;br /&gt;
pect of a rupture between them. About nine&lt;br /&gt;
o’clock he went to the house. Eliza was alrea-&lt;br /&gt;
dy up, and as soon as she understood he was&lt;br /&gt;
there, desired to see him. She related to him&lt;br /&gt;
every minute circumstance of the preceding day’s&lt;br /&gt;
adventure, while he endeavored to represent&lt;br /&gt;
the conduct of Palmer in the most odious light.&lt;br /&gt;
Blake was invited to stay to breakfast, which in-&lt;br /&gt;
vitation he accepted, and shortly after took his&lt;br /&gt;
leave, complimented with the polite obligations&lt;br /&gt;
of the family, and the grateful acknowledgments&lt;br /&gt;
of Eliza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When he returned home, a servant was wait-&lt;br /&gt;
ing at the door, from whom he received the fol-&lt;br /&gt;
lowing note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To&lt;/em&gt; J. Blake, &lt;em&gt;Esq.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Sir,&lt;br /&gt;
“You must undoubtedly have expected to&lt;br /&gt;
hear from me before this time. You will accept&lt;br /&gt;
a reasonable excuse–I slept late, and have but&lt;br /&gt;
this moment arrived in town. A few hours can-&lt;br /&gt;
not be considered too long to examine our pistols,&lt;br /&gt;
and prepare for, possibly, serious events. I,&lt;br /&gt;
therefore, take the liberty to request you to meet&lt;br /&gt;
me, with a single friend, in the fields, one mile&lt;br /&gt;
north of the town, just back of the new build-&lt;br /&gt;
ing, precisely at 5 o’clock in the evening. –&lt;br /&gt;
Should you have any objections to these arrange-&lt;br /&gt;
ments, you will please to notify me.&lt;br /&gt;
“Yours, &amp;amp;c. S. PALMER.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;9 O’clock, Thursday morning.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To which Blake returned the following answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;To&lt;/em&gt; S. PALMER, &lt;em&gt;Esq.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
“Sir,&lt;br /&gt;
“I shall punctually attend to the ar-&lt;br /&gt;
rangments pointed out in your note of this mor-&lt;br /&gt;
ning. “I am, &amp;amp;c. J. Blake.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Thursday morning, 11 o’clock.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake immediately made the necessary prepara-&lt;br /&gt;
tions, and at the hour appointed, they were both&lt;br /&gt;
on the spot. They agreed to fire, on a signal&lt;br /&gt;
given by the seconds, at the distance of ten pa-&lt;br /&gt;
ces. They took their stands, in a cool and deli-&lt;br /&gt;
berate manner, and at the signal given, Palmer&lt;br /&gt;
fired, and Blake received the ball in his breast.&lt;br /&gt;
He staggered, but did not fall. A momentary&lt;br /&gt;
pause ensued—-&lt;br /&gt;
“Do you intend to fire?” enquired Pal-&lt;br /&gt;
mer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Blake.&lt;/em&gt; Are you now satisfied?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Palmer.&lt;/em&gt; You are wounded?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Blake.&lt;/em&gt; I am.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Palmer.&lt;/em&gt; Is the wound mortal?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Blake.&lt;/em&gt; It is only a flesh wound.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Palmer.&lt;/em&gt; Then I am not satisfied.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Blake.&lt;/em&gt; I must then act in my own defence–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They both fired, and Palmer fell. He rolled up-&lt;br /&gt;
on the ground, and expired with a single groan.&lt;br /&gt;
Blake fainted through loss of blood, but soon&lt;br /&gt;
recovered, His wound, it is true, was only a&lt;br /&gt;
flesh wound, but it was deep, and had opened an&lt;br /&gt;
artery. Palmer was shot through the region of&lt;br /&gt;
the heart. His body was removed to the new&lt;br /&gt;
building, which was unoccupied, and secretly&lt;br /&gt;
buried in the night. The connections of the&lt;br /&gt;
parties hushed up the affair, and as no surgeon&lt;br /&gt;
was called, no other persons were privy to the&lt;br /&gt;
affair, except the seconds. It was given out&lt;br /&gt;
that Palmer had fled, on account of a prosecuti-&lt;br /&gt;
on about to be set on foot against him by the&lt;br /&gt;
friends of Eliza. Blake kept his chamber a few&lt;br /&gt;
days, and again appeared in public.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliza considered herself under the highest ob-&lt;br /&gt;
ligations to Blake. He had extricated her from a&lt;br /&gt;
dangerous dilemma; and although she could not&lt;br /&gt;
receive him on the footing of a suitor, yet grati-&lt;br /&gt;
tude forbade her, totally, to refuse his visits.&lt;br /&gt;
He was, therefore, frequently at her uncle’s, and&lt;br /&gt;
sometimes permitted to attend her abroad. His&lt;br /&gt;
conduct, now, appeared disinterested. He did not&lt;br /&gt;
attempt to renew his addresses, but behaved to&lt;br /&gt;
her more like a guardian friend and brother,&lt;br /&gt;
than a lover; and so generously candid were all&lt;br /&gt;
his actions, that she finally admitted his visits&lt;br /&gt;
without reserve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Winter came, and the time had elapsed in&lt;br /&gt;
which Albert was expected. Eliza had, one day,&lt;br /&gt;
been reading his letter, when she was suddenly&lt;br /&gt;
called away by her aunt, on some business. In&lt;br /&gt;
her absence, Blake entered her room: Albert’s&lt;br /&gt;
letter lay open upon her dressing table; he hasti-&lt;br /&gt;
ly ran over the contents–he was thunderstruck!&lt;br /&gt;
A crowd of chaotic ideas rushed into his mind.&lt;br /&gt;
He found that Palmer had been only the ostensi-&lt;br /&gt;
ble barrier to his wishes, and although this ob-&lt;br /&gt;
stacle was now removed, yet he had a more for-&lt;br /&gt;
midable one to encounter. But who was Al-&lt;br /&gt;
bert? He had never even heard his name menti-&lt;br /&gt;
oned. Whoever he was, it was certain he had&lt;br /&gt;
not yet returned. It was possible he never might&lt;br /&gt;
return. Or if he should, it might not be so soon&lt;br /&gt;
as was expected, and in that case, perhaps Eliza&lt;br /&gt;
might change her mind; at least his own happi-&lt;br /&gt;
ness demanded that nothing should be wanting,&lt;br /&gt;
on his part, to influence her so to do. Blake&lt;br /&gt;
hurried away without seeing Eliza, resolving to&lt;br /&gt;
pursue such measures as future circumstances&lt;br /&gt;
should require.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliza became dejected, as the months rolled&lt;br /&gt;
away after the time she had calculated for Al-&lt;br /&gt;
bert to arrive. She framed a thousand excu-&lt;br /&gt;
ses for this delay, and abandoned them almost as&lt;br /&gt;
soon as framed. She had written to him, after&lt;br /&gt;
receiving his letter, but had no answer there-&lt;br /&gt;
to; hence she concluded that he must be about&lt;br /&gt;
to return, or he would have written to&lt;br /&gt;
her; and though gloomy presages often crossed&lt;br /&gt;
her imagination, yet she consoled herself in as-&lt;br /&gt;
surances of his speedy arrival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Blake was constantly inventing some new en-&lt;br /&gt;
tertainment to divert Eliza. Balls, select par-&lt;br /&gt;
ties and visiting were the amusements of the win-&lt;br /&gt;
ter. As Eliza returned from a visit one evening,&lt;br /&gt;
attended by Blake, she was agreeably surprized&lt;br /&gt;
to find her father, who had just arrived, and had&lt;br /&gt;
come, upon her request, to carry her home.&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza was highly pleased with the idea of re-&lt;br /&gt;
turning to her family, and again enjoying the&lt;br /&gt;
pleasure of her native shades; but when her fa-&lt;br /&gt;
ther’s business was made known, her cousins so&lt;br /&gt;
earnestly urged her to tarry through the winter,&lt;br /&gt;
that, with her father’s leave, she consented.&lt;br /&gt;
The old gentleman, upon an invitation, through&lt;br /&gt;
Blake, waited on the Governor, and in a few&lt;br /&gt;
days returned to Long-Island.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The winter passed away, and spring arrived,&lt;br /&gt;
but no news from Albert. Eliza became melan-&lt;br /&gt;
choly, and could scarcely be prevailed upon to&lt;br /&gt;
see company. One afternoon, as she, with her&lt;br /&gt;
uncle’s family and Blake, was sitting in the pi-&lt;br /&gt;
azza, in front of the house, a well-dressed man&lt;br /&gt;
approached, who, after politely complimenting&lt;br /&gt;
the company, enquired if a gentleman of the&lt;br /&gt;
name of Blake was there. Blake answered to the&lt;br /&gt;
enquiry: The stranger said he had just arrived&lt;br /&gt;
from England, and had the charge of a few let-&lt;br /&gt;
ters, one of which was for him; he handed a let-&lt;br /&gt;
ter to Blake, and then asked if post-offices were&lt;br /&gt;
established in this country, saying he had a letter&lt;br /&gt;
from a young gentleman in England to his fa-&lt;br /&gt;
ther on Long-Island, which he had engaged should&lt;br /&gt;
receive safe conveyance. “What is the gentle-&lt;br /&gt;
man’s name?” asked Blake. He mentioned the&lt;br /&gt;
name of Albert’s father. “Is the young man&lt;br /&gt;
about to return to America?” enquired Eliza’s&lt;br /&gt;
uncle. “I believe he will not soon return,” an-&lt;br /&gt;
swered the stranger; “he went over to take pos-&lt;br /&gt;
session of an estate which descended to him from&lt;br /&gt;
his ancestors, and which he obtained.” –“You&lt;br /&gt;
know him, then!” interrupted Eliza’s aunt. –&lt;br /&gt;
“Know him, madam! very well, indeed; he is&lt;br /&gt;
my particular friend. –Had it not been for my&lt;br /&gt;
advice, he would not so easily have made his for-&lt;br /&gt;
tune. A young lady, with thirty thousand pounds&lt;br /&gt;
in her own power, fell desperately in love with&lt;br /&gt;
him; he made some scruples, and talked of at-&lt;br /&gt;
tachments in this country, but we soon jeered&lt;br /&gt;
him out of such silly notions; he married the la-&lt;br /&gt;
dy, and now figures away in his coach and&lt;br /&gt;
six, among the first characters in London.”&lt;br /&gt;
During this short narration, Eliza, with all&lt;br /&gt;
the symptoms of the keenest anxiety, kept her&lt;br /&gt;
eye fixed upon the speaker, until he mentioned&lt;br /&gt;
the marriage of Albert, when, suddenly a death-&lt;br /&gt;
like paleness overspread her face, intermingled&lt;br /&gt;
with flashes of glowing red; she was sinking&lt;br /&gt;
from her seat, when her aunt took her arm and&lt;br /&gt;
assisted her into the house, and the stranger de-&lt;br /&gt;
parted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(To be continued.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[5. 6 July 1802]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FOR several days, Eliza did not leave her&lt;br /&gt;
chamber, and could scarcely be prevailed&lt;br /&gt;
upon to take any kind of nourishment. She gave&lt;br /&gt;
herself up to the keenest reflections, and the severest&lt;br /&gt;
anxieties of grief, which,&lt;br /&gt;
—-&lt;em&gt;“Like a worm in the bud,”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“Fed on her demask cheek.”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
As the &lt;em&gt;tide&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;of sorrows&lt;/em&gt; gradually abated, she&lt;br /&gt;
was left a monument of its ravages. On that coun-&lt;br /&gt;
tenance where joy and delight, late sported with&lt;br /&gt;
a thousand varying graces, pale melancholy now&lt;br /&gt;
fate enthroned, in gloomy silence. The wound&lt;br /&gt;
which Albert’s perfidy had inflicted in her bosom,&lt;br /&gt;
was too deep for the balsam of time to heal. –&lt;br /&gt;
Could it be possible he should prove thus faith-&lt;br /&gt;
less? Could he give that hand to another, which,&lt;br /&gt;
with the most solemn adjurations, he had devo-&lt;br /&gt;
ted to her? Could that heart become suscepti-&lt;br /&gt;
ble of other impressions, which once glowed on-&lt;br /&gt;
ly with her charms, and bear for her alone? –&lt;br /&gt;
“Cruel fortune,” she would say, “how wretch-&lt;br /&gt;
edly hast thou deceived him! Thy gold, thy tin-&lt;br /&gt;
sel, and thy splendors, have allured him from the&lt;br /&gt;
paths of rectitude; for although he has given&lt;br /&gt;
his hand to another, his heart is still with Eliza;&lt;br /&gt;
and though he may, for a while, riot in luxuri-&lt;br /&gt;
ous dissipation, yet shall the pathos of repentance&lt;br /&gt;
wring his bosom, when the gay, deceptive ob-&lt;br /&gt;
jects which now surround him, shall be stript of&lt;br /&gt;
their false attire, and lose their delusive power to&lt;br /&gt;
charm!” –Infatuated girl! thou hast yet but&lt;br /&gt;
partially experienced the fascinating influences of&lt;br /&gt;
grandeur and of novely. Thy thoughts are in-&lt;br /&gt;
nocent; deception finds no place in thy breast.&lt;br /&gt;
Such was Albert when he left the peaceful shades&lt;br /&gt;
of his rural dwelling. He loved, and his love&lt;br /&gt;
was as sincere as thine. But so sudden a transi-&lt;br /&gt;
tion from the simple walks of Nature, to the most&lt;br /&gt;
exalted refinements of Art; his immediate ac-&lt;br /&gt;
quisition of property; frequent intercourse with&lt;br /&gt;
fashionable circles; the long absence, and the&lt;br /&gt;
wide distance which separated him from the maid&lt;br /&gt;
of his early choice; and, above all, the delicate&lt;br /&gt;
and irresistable attractions, and tender solicitudes&lt;br /&gt;
of female blandishment, must, unless Albert pos-&lt;br /&gt;
sessed more than human firmness, weaken, at least,&lt;br /&gt;
if not totally disengage, all prior attachments.&lt;br /&gt;
This extenuation, however, did not present it-&lt;br /&gt;
self to the anguished mind of Eliza. She consi-&lt;br /&gt;
dered him as the murderer of her peace, and as&lt;br /&gt;
the assassinator of all her future prospects of hap-&lt;br /&gt;
piness. Recollection, and the disappointed delu-&lt;br /&gt;
sions of anticipation, constantly harrassed her&lt;br /&gt;
senses, and she languished under all the bitterness&lt;br /&gt;
of the most poignant sorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the storm of grief began, at length, gradu-&lt;br /&gt;
ally to subside. Pride came to the assistance of&lt;br /&gt;
disappointed hope, and a delicate resentment,&lt;br /&gt;
prompted by a deep sense of injury, succeeded to&lt;br /&gt;
sensations of the most ardent affection. Was&lt;br /&gt;
Albert capable of such perfidious volatility? –&lt;br /&gt;
Could he, in defiance of the most sacred obligati-&lt;br /&gt;
ons and seemingly sincere professions, thus a-&lt;br /&gt;
bandon her to misery and wretchedness, for&lt;br /&gt;
the paltry consideration of property and fame?&lt;br /&gt;
Or was it more probable that the brilliancy&lt;br /&gt;
of new objects had raised a new passion in his&lt;br /&gt;
bosom? Amid the constellated beauties of Lon-&lt;br /&gt;
don, some one had been found whose charms and&lt;br /&gt;
graces had dissolved the ties between herself and&lt;br /&gt;
Albert, by changing his boasted sincerity into in-&lt;br /&gt;
constancy, and rendering the simple Eliza, the&lt;br /&gt;
object, perhaps, of ridicule and contempt; at&lt;br /&gt;
least of cold neglect and inattention. Whatever&lt;br /&gt;
was the cause, his affections were now, inviola-&lt;br /&gt;
bly, the property of another, and she determi-&lt;br /&gt;
nately resolved,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;—-“To drive him out from all her thoughts, *&lt;br /&gt;
*“As far as she was able.”&lt;/em&gt; —-&lt;br /&gt;
After taking this firm resolution she became more&lt;br /&gt;
composed, but was averse to receiving any kind&lt;br /&gt;
of company. Blake had frequently called, and&lt;br /&gt;
was told she was indisposed; but as soon as&lt;br /&gt;
she was able to walk out, he was permitted to at-&lt;br /&gt;
tend her. Their walks were, by her desire, in&lt;br /&gt;
the most unfrequented parts of the city, and ge-&lt;br /&gt;
nerally, in the twilight of the evening. When&lt;br /&gt;
she was not disposed to walk, he would frequent-&lt;br /&gt;
ly sit in her room, and read to her passages from&lt;br /&gt;
some amusing book, which tended to exhilarate her&lt;br /&gt;
spirits, detach her ideas from gloomy subjects,&lt;br /&gt;
and lead them to the more brilliant fields of fan-&lt;br /&gt;
cy. Sometimes she consented to ride out with&lt;br /&gt;
him, a little distance from the city, in his coach.&lt;br /&gt;
By such attentions he became her principal con-&lt;br /&gt;
fidant; but she did not entrust him, or any other&lt;br /&gt;
person, with the affair of Albert. Her uncle and&lt;br /&gt;
aunt had some little knowledge of the circum-&lt;br /&gt;
stances; her cousins knew nothing of them. –&lt;br /&gt;
Her indisposition was imputed to other causes;&lt;br /&gt;
her aunt, however, had reason for a different o-&lt;br /&gt;
pinion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About this time Eliza received a letter from&lt;br /&gt;
her father, in which he desired her to inform&lt;br /&gt;
him whether she wished to return home. In a&lt;br /&gt;
postscript to the letter, it was mentioned that&lt;br /&gt;
Albert’s father, whose health had, for some time,&lt;br /&gt;
been on the decline, was dead; that on an investi-&lt;br /&gt;
gation of his accounts, his estate was found to be&lt;br /&gt;
insolvent; that his property had been divided a-&lt;br /&gt;
mong his creditors, and that Albert’s mother had&lt;br /&gt;
gone to reside with one of her brethren upon the&lt;br /&gt;
continent. Albert’s return was mentioned as&lt;br /&gt;
doubtful; Eliza’s father knew of but one letter&lt;br /&gt;
he had written to his parents, the contents of&lt;br /&gt;
which he appeared to be unacquainted with. He,&lt;br /&gt;
therefore, gently admonished her not to place so&lt;br /&gt;
strong a confidence in distant and uncertain pros-&lt;br /&gt;
pects, as her peace would be destroyed, should&lt;br /&gt;
her expectations be disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This caution was unnecessary. Eliza had al-&lt;br /&gt;
ready experienced all the disappointment which&lt;br /&gt;
her father’s letter contemplated and she had sur-&lt;br /&gt;
vived the shock of conflicting passions, which suc-&lt;br /&gt;
ceeded. She could not forbear dropping a tear&lt;br /&gt;
over the ruins of Albert’s family, but she did not&lt;br /&gt;
feel that interest in the circumstances which she&lt;br /&gt;
once would have done. To return home, at the&lt;br /&gt;
present juncture, she had no inclinations. Every&lt;br /&gt;
object which there presented, would awaken&lt;br /&gt;
feelings which she now wished might be oblitera-&lt;br /&gt;
ted. She therefore wrote to her father that, if&lt;br /&gt;
consistent with his family arrangements, she&lt;br /&gt;
would continue a while longer with her uncle.&lt;br /&gt;
While the summer passed on, Blake was inde-&lt;br /&gt;
fatigable in his exertions to amuse Eliza; and,&lt;br /&gt;
for this purpose, a continual round of entertain-&lt;br /&gt;
ments was kept up. Excursions into the coun-&lt;br /&gt;
try, in coaches and on horseback; walking along&lt;br /&gt;
the banks of the East and North Rivers, and barge-&lt;br /&gt;
sailing in the harbor, were among the first di-&lt;br /&gt;
versions. As they were out on one of the last&lt;br /&gt;
mentioned recreations, one pleasant after-&lt;br /&gt;
noon, it happened that the barge in which were&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza, Miss Smith, and others, lingered a little&lt;br /&gt;
behind the rest. They were standing up; Miss&lt;br /&gt;
Smith, in walking hastily along the boat, made&lt;br /&gt;
a false step, and fell forcibly against Eliza, by&lt;br /&gt;
which she was suddenly precipitated into the&lt;br /&gt;
deep. A scream was raised by the ladies; Blake,&lt;br /&gt;
who was in another boat, at a little distance,&lt;br /&gt;
turned his eyes, and saw Eliza struggling with&lt;br /&gt;
the waves. He immediately plunged into the&lt;br /&gt;
water, and swam to her relief. Before he reach-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the place, she sunk, but as she arose he&lt;br /&gt;
caught her, and, with much difficulty, conveyed&lt;br /&gt;
her safely to the barge. This accident discoura-&lt;br /&gt;
ged Eliza from again venturing upon the water.&lt;br /&gt;
Some time after this, as Blake was sitting with&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza, in her apartment, he addressed her as fol-&lt;br /&gt;
lows: –“You cannot be insensible, madam, that&lt;br /&gt;
it is with the highest pleasure I have been per-&lt;br /&gt;
mitted to devote some little services to you; in-&lt;br /&gt;
deed, I can truly say, that since I became ac-&lt;br /&gt;
quainted with you, I have experienced more real&lt;br /&gt;
happiness than I ever before enjoyed. But the&lt;br /&gt;
time has now arrived, when a continuation of these&lt;br /&gt;
services may, as it respects yourself, be considered&lt;br /&gt;
improper. I am set down as your admirer:. If&lt;br /&gt;
I continue my attendance, it may prevent you&lt;br /&gt;
from receiving offers more agreeable to your&lt;br /&gt;
mind; and, what is more, it may, as to the fal-&lt;br /&gt;
lacy of public opinion, hazard your reputation,&lt;br /&gt;
which is far dearer to me than my own. There&lt;br /&gt;
is, therefore, but two alternatives, and these de-&lt;br /&gt;
pend on your own choice. The first is, to break&lt;br /&gt;
off all connection instantly; in this case I shall&lt;br /&gt;
leave America immediately, and strive, by travel&lt;br /&gt;
and change of objects, to divert a hopeless passi-&lt;br /&gt;
on; for, when banished from you, I shall never&lt;br /&gt;
more see a moment of real comfort. –The other&lt;br /&gt;
is, that you accept my hand, which, with all the&lt;br /&gt;
powers of my soul, shall ever be devoted to ren-&lt;br /&gt;
der your situation as happy as this life will admit.&lt;br /&gt;
I will now leave you, that you may think of the&lt;br /&gt;
subject, and will call to-morrow evening for your&lt;br /&gt;
answer.” He then withdrew, and Eliza was left&lt;br /&gt;
to her own meditations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliza felt the candor of this declaration. It&lt;br /&gt;
was ingenious–it was honorable. Blake had&lt;br /&gt;
been, to her, the sincerest friend. He had once&lt;br /&gt;
snatched her from the verge of death, at the risk&lt;br /&gt;
of his own life–once from that which, perhaps,&lt;br /&gt;
would have been worse than death. He was a&lt;br /&gt;
character held in high estimation–his property&lt;br /&gt;
large–his connections respectable. Her father&lt;br /&gt;
was a man of but moderate income; the time&lt;br /&gt;
might be near when he would be no more, and&lt;br /&gt;
then where was she to look for a guardian! She&lt;br /&gt;
had no brother, and only two sisters, who were&lt;br /&gt;
very young. Affection, it is true, she had none&lt;br /&gt;
to bestow; but if ever she thought of connecting&lt;br /&gt;
herself to any one, was it probable she would find&lt;br /&gt;
a person of purer principles than Blake? She de-&lt;br /&gt;
termined, however to do nothing rashly, and to&lt;br /&gt;
take proper time before she gave an answer.&lt;br /&gt;
When Blake called the following evening,&lt;br /&gt;
she told him that so important an affair demanded&lt;br /&gt;
serious consideration. That its consequences must&lt;br /&gt;
embrace a variety of objects, and therefore some&lt;br /&gt;
time would be requisite; that, for the present,&lt;br /&gt;
she thought it advisable for him to withdraw his&lt;br /&gt;
visits: and that, in one month from that time,&lt;br /&gt;
she would give him a decisive answer. Blake ac-&lt;br /&gt;
knowledged the propriety of these remarks, and&lt;br /&gt;
after acceding to the plan, retired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliza laid the affair before her uncle and aunt,&lt;br /&gt;
who highly recommended Blake, and advised her,&lt;br /&gt;
by all means not to reject so fair an opportunity,&lt;br /&gt;
as they expressed it, saying there were few ladies&lt;br /&gt;
in the city but who should think themselves much&lt;br /&gt;
honored by being placed in her situation.&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza stepped into a milliner’s shop, one day,&lt;br /&gt;
and was obliged to wait for the following dis-&lt;br /&gt;
course to be ended, between the milliner and a&lt;br /&gt;
strange lady, before she could be waited upon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Milliner.&lt;/em&gt; Married, do you say, and to a lady&lt;br /&gt;
of fortune in London?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stranger.&lt;/em&gt; Not only to a fortune, but to a lady&lt;br /&gt;
of family, and one of the first beauties in En-&lt;br /&gt;
gland.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mil.&lt;/em&gt; And keeps a coach?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Stran.&lt;/em&gt; A coach and livery servants; and when&lt;br /&gt;
I left London, about two months ago, there was&lt;br /&gt;
talk of his purchasing a title.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Mil.&lt;/em&gt; Well, this is a strange business. I knew&lt;br /&gt;
the family of the *******’s (here she mentioned&lt;br /&gt;
Albert’s family name) very well when I lived on&lt;br /&gt;
the Island; they were always exceeding &lt;em&gt;clever *&lt;br /&gt;
*bodies;&lt;/em&gt; it has happened well for this young man,&lt;br /&gt;
for his father died not worth a groat. —-Here&lt;br /&gt;
she fixed her eyes on Eliza, and supposing she&lt;br /&gt;
wanted something out of her shop, the discourse&lt;br /&gt;
was broken off. Eliza purchased the articles she&lt;br /&gt;
wanted, and left the shop. “And is it thus,”&lt;br /&gt;
said she, as she returned home, “is Albert to&lt;br /&gt;
become an English nobleman! The time will&lt;br /&gt;
most assuredly come, when in tears of blood, he&lt;br /&gt;
will mourn over his sacrilegious honors, wither-&lt;br /&gt;
ing in the dust.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day which Eliza had set to give an an-&lt;br /&gt;
swer to Blake, had now arrived–the longest&lt;br /&gt;
month which she had ever experienced. Eliza in-&lt;br /&gt;
formed him that she had concluded to accede to&lt;br /&gt;
his proposals, provided her father’s consent could&lt;br /&gt;
be obtained. This answer fully compensated&lt;br /&gt;
Blake for the anxieties under which his mind&lt;br /&gt;
had for a long time labored. He immediately&lt;br /&gt;
wrote to her father, and received for answer, that,&lt;br /&gt;
as he had been well informed of Blake’s situati-&lt;br /&gt;
on, connections and character, he had no objec-&lt;br /&gt;
tions to the union.—-As winter had now arri-&lt;br /&gt;
ved, it was concluded to defer the nuptials until&lt;br /&gt;
spring, when they were to be celebrated at her&lt;br /&gt;
father’s house.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a ball, one evening, as Eliza and Miss&lt;br /&gt;
Smith were sitting together, after the fatigues of&lt;br /&gt;
a contra-dance, Miss Smith took Eliza’s hand,&lt;br /&gt;
pressed it with vehemence, and sighed deeply,&lt;br /&gt;
“Eliza,” says she, “I esteem and pity you;&lt;br /&gt;
your innocence and your credulity, my dear girl,&lt;br /&gt;
are soon to be wrecked upon the shoals of des-&lt;br /&gt;
pair.” “What means such a portentous pre-&lt;br /&gt;
diction?” replied Eliza. ‘“&lt;em&gt;That&lt;/em&gt; you may here-&lt;br /&gt;
after know,” answered Miss Smith, “but never&lt;br /&gt;
from me.” At this instant Blake joined them,&lt;br /&gt;
which put an end to the conversation. Eliza&lt;br /&gt;
supposed these observations proceeded from the&lt;br /&gt;
disappointment which Miss Smith had experien-&lt;br /&gt;
ced, as her regard for Blake was no secret. Eli-&lt;br /&gt;
za, however, related the circumstance to Blake,&lt;br /&gt;
which she thought appeared a little to shock him,&lt;br /&gt;
but he changed the discourse, and no farther no-&lt;br /&gt;
tice was then taken of it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after this, Miss Smith disappeared.–&lt;br /&gt;
Blake informed Eliza that she had gone to New-&lt;br /&gt;
Jersey, on a visit to a friend, and would not re-&lt;br /&gt;
turn in a considerable time. Eliza thought it a&lt;br /&gt;
little singular that she had never informed her of&lt;br /&gt;
her intentions. But as Miss Smith had lately,&lt;br /&gt;
in some measure, withdrawn her intimacies, Eli-&lt;br /&gt;
za imputed this reserve to the same cause which&lt;br /&gt;
produced the conversation at the ball.&lt;br /&gt;
The winter passed away, and spring at length&lt;br /&gt;
arrived, the time in which the Hymeneal rites&lt;br /&gt;
were to be celebrated between Blake and Eliza.&lt;br /&gt;
Preparations were, therefore, made for the jour-&lt;br /&gt;
ney home, in which she was to be attended by&lt;br /&gt;
Blake and the family of her uncle. The night&lt;br /&gt;
before they were to set out, Eliza dreamed she&lt;br /&gt;
was riding with Blake in his coach, when a sud-&lt;br /&gt;
den flash of lightning issued from the heavens,&lt;br /&gt;
followed by a loud peal of crashing thunder! The&lt;br /&gt;
horses started, and ran furiously forward towards&lt;br /&gt;
a dangerous precipice, beneath, which a raging&lt;br /&gt;
torrent foamed among the rocks. She thought&lt;br /&gt;
that she endeavored to disengage herself from the&lt;br /&gt;
carriage, but in vain; they were hurried along,&lt;br /&gt;
with amazing swiftness, to the top of the cliff,&lt;br /&gt;
and were just upon the point of being hurled down,&lt;br /&gt;
when a man, who appeared to descend through&lt;br /&gt;
the air, seized Eliza by the arm, and, in an in-&lt;br /&gt;
stant, bore her, in safety, to the other side of the&lt;br /&gt;
river, from whence she beheld the coach, with&lt;br /&gt;
Blake and the horses, precipitated headlong from&lt;br /&gt;
the tremendous height, and dashed in pieces up-&lt;br /&gt;
on the rocks below. She awaked with a scream,&lt;br /&gt;
and rejoiced to find the scene illusory. The&lt;br /&gt;
lineaments of the stranger’s countenance were&lt;br /&gt;
not entirely erased from her memory; they ap-&lt;br /&gt;
peared familiar, but she could not recollect where&lt;br /&gt;
she had seen the original. The consequence of the&lt;br /&gt;
dream hung ominously upon her imagination; but&lt;br /&gt;
the bright rays of the sun which now darted in-&lt;br /&gt;
to her chamber, dispelled the gloom that hovered&lt;br /&gt;
around her. She arose immediately, got ready&lt;br /&gt;
for her journey, and at evening she, with her un-&lt;br /&gt;
cle’s family and Blake, was at her father’s house&lt;br /&gt;
Scenes of tenderness ensued upon Eliza’s re-&lt;br /&gt;
turn to her family. As it was but a few days&lt;br /&gt;
before the intended nuptials, invitations were im-&lt;br /&gt;
mediately sent abroad. Blake’s friends soon ar-&lt;br /&gt;
rived from New-York, among whom was the go-&lt;br /&gt;
vernor. On the afternoon of the day in which,&lt;br /&gt;
at evening, the marriage was to be consum-&lt;br /&gt;
mated, Eliza walked out alone, to contemplate&lt;br /&gt;
the beauties of the spring. It was the latter&lt;br /&gt;
part of the month of May. The air was embalm-&lt;br /&gt;
ed with the fragrance of the surrounding flow-&lt;br /&gt;
ers, and the mingling melody of various birds&lt;br /&gt;
echoed along the adjacent grove. She roved,&lt;br /&gt;
she scarcely knew whither, until she was instinc-&lt;br /&gt;
tively led to the shores of Montauk, and found&lt;br /&gt;
herself at last upon the very spot she stood&lt;br /&gt;
when Albert’s ship disappeared from her sight.&lt;br /&gt;
It was now something more than three years&lt;br /&gt;
since that time. She earnestly fixed her eyes up-&lt;br /&gt;
on the place; a tall ship was beating in for the&lt;br /&gt;
port. The joys of past days rushed, like a tor-&lt;br /&gt;
rent, upon her memory. She was suddenly a-&lt;br /&gt;
roused to a solemn sense of her desperate situati-&lt;br /&gt;
on. The lightnings of conviction flashed, and&lt;br /&gt;
the thunders of terror followed!–she was about&lt;br /&gt;
to deceive a worthy character, by yielding him&lt;br /&gt;
her hand, while her affections were dead to all&lt;br /&gt;
except a hopeless object. What was to&lt;br /&gt;
be done? To advance was destruction!–to re-&lt;br /&gt;
treat–impossible! She hurried home, and strove&lt;br /&gt;
to suppress contemplation, amidst the hilarity of&lt;br /&gt;
the guest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moment at length arrived in which cer-&lt;br /&gt;
tainty must succeed to suspense and anxiety. E-&lt;br /&gt;
liza trembled as she was led up before the priest,&lt;br /&gt;
and she shuddered when the direction was given&lt;br /&gt;
for joining hands.–At this instant a stranger&lt;br /&gt;
was announced by the servants, who desired to&lt;br /&gt;
be immediately admitted, as he had something&lt;br /&gt;
of importance to communicate to Eliza’s father.&lt;br /&gt;
It was a critical time–he could not then be at-&lt;br /&gt;
tended to. The stranger did not wait for com-&lt;br /&gt;
plaisance. –A pale and emaciated figure pressed&lt;br /&gt;
through the crowd, and came near to the place&lt;br /&gt;
where the ceremony was performing. Eliza’s&lt;br /&gt;
eye caught his countenance–It was the person&lt;br /&gt;
who had assisted her in her dream! But what was&lt;br /&gt;
her amazement, when, upon advancing a lit-&lt;br /&gt;
tle nearer, she perfectly recollected the fading&lt;br /&gt;
features of her long lost Albert! She uttered a&lt;br /&gt;
shriek of agony, and sunk, senseless, to the floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(To be continued.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[6. 13 July 1802]&lt;br /&gt;
The women flew to the assistance of Eliza,&lt;br /&gt;
raised her up, and conveyed her to another&lt;br /&gt;
room. The house was in confusion. No one&lt;br /&gt;
knew the cause of her sudden illness. Albert was&lt;br /&gt;
not even known to her father: he had but slightly&lt;br /&gt;
noticed him, and amidst the disorder which now&lt;br /&gt;
took place, he thought more of him. When&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza recovered, she desired that all might with-&lt;br /&gt;
draw from her except her parents; this being&lt;br /&gt;
done, she then informed them, that the stranger&lt;br /&gt;
who had thus suddenly made his appearance was&lt;br /&gt;
Albert. She desired her father to enquire his&lt;br /&gt;
business, but by no means to admit him into her&lt;br /&gt;
presence. Her father immediately went out, and&lt;br /&gt;
found Albert traversing the hall, seemingly in&lt;br /&gt;
much agitation. A short conversation took&lt;br /&gt;
place. Albert requested to see Eliza. Her fa-&lt;br /&gt;
ther told him that she had already refused to see&lt;br /&gt;
him, but that he would again consult her, and if&lt;br /&gt;
she consented, he would have no objections. He&lt;br /&gt;
then left him, but soon returned, and informed&lt;br /&gt;
him that Eliza was willing to see him in the pre-&lt;br /&gt;
sence of her parents, to whom he wished to add&lt;br /&gt;
another person, and this was Blake, who, her fa-&lt;br /&gt;
ther observed, had now an undoubted right to be&lt;br /&gt;
present, when any thing of a personal nature&lt;br /&gt;
which concerned Eliza, was to be communicat-&lt;br /&gt;
ed. Albert intreated that he might be permit-&lt;br /&gt;
ted to see her, for a few moments, according to&lt;br /&gt;
her own stipulation, in the presence, only, of her&lt;br /&gt;
parents. This her father granted, with a provi-&lt;br /&gt;
so, that Blake should be previously acquainted&lt;br /&gt;
with it, which being done, and Blake, with some&lt;br /&gt;
reluctance, agreeing to it, Albert was immedi-&lt;br /&gt;
ately introduced. Eliza was reclining upon a&lt;br /&gt;
sofa; as he entered, a deep crimson suffused her&lt;br /&gt;
cheeks, to which a livid paleness soon succeeded.&lt;br /&gt;
Albert trembled–their eyes met–he hesitated.–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Albert.&lt;/em&gt; (As he slowly approached the sofa)&lt;br /&gt;
“Eliza!” She answered only by a deep sigh. A&lt;br /&gt;
solemn pause ensued—-&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Albert.&lt;/em&gt; (With more earnestness, advancing still&lt;br /&gt;
nearer, and sighing responsively) “Eliza!”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Eliza.&lt;/em&gt; “Albert!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Articulation became suspended–they could not&lt;br /&gt;
pronounce another word–their eyes spoke unut-&lt;br /&gt;
erable anguish. Eliza sunk upon her mother’s&lt;br /&gt;
bosom. her father then thus addressed Albert:&lt;br /&gt;
“You know, Sir, that I sanctioned your preten-&lt;br /&gt;
sions to my daughter, previous to your leaving A-&lt;br /&gt;
merica. Your long stay in England; your im-&lt;br /&gt;
plicit silence, in this long absence, except in a&lt;br /&gt;
single instance, added to the reports of you&lt;br /&gt;
connecting yourself in marriage in that country, have&lt;br /&gt;
produced the events you now behold. There ap-&lt;br /&gt;
pears some mystery in this business: circumstan-&lt;br /&gt;
ces will not as you see, admit an explanation at&lt;br /&gt;
present. If you will call to-morrow morning, at&lt;br /&gt;
ten o’clock, the matter shall be investigated.–&lt;br /&gt;
My daughter’s peace of mind lies near my heart;&lt;br /&gt;
and although it is probable that what is already&lt;br /&gt;
done cannot be retracted, yet it will not be amiss&lt;br /&gt;
to know the truth.” Albert would have replied;&lt;br /&gt;
but as Eliza had only partially recovered from&lt;br /&gt;
the shock she had received by his sudden appear-&lt;br /&gt;
ance, and a sense of her critical situation, the&lt;br /&gt;
least irritation might cause a relapse; he there-&lt;br /&gt;
fore retired, in much agitation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eliza’s uncle had related to her father the par-&lt;br /&gt;
ticulars of the stranger’s story, who presented the&lt;br /&gt;
letter to Blake, as mentioned before. Hence,&lt;br /&gt;
as he observed to Albert, he suspected some mys-&lt;br /&gt;
tery attending the affair. Eliza, from Albert’s&lt;br /&gt;
manner and conduct, imagined she had been de-&lt;br /&gt;
ceived, and her suspicions fell upon Blake. Al-&lt;br /&gt;
bert’s sentiments were the same. Blake was ad-&lt;br /&gt;
mitted into Eliza’s room after Albert was gone;&lt;br /&gt;
he did not, however, stay long; she wished to be&lt;br /&gt;
alone, and in this her parents chose to indulge&lt;br /&gt;
her. His feelings were wrought up to the high-&lt;br /&gt;
est pitch; Albert’s unexpected return had ren-&lt;br /&gt;
dered his situation peculiarly interesting, and his&lt;br /&gt;
hopes of happiness exceedingly precarious.–The&lt;br /&gt;
guests were informed, that a sudden illness hav-&lt;br /&gt;
ing seized Eliza, she was obliged to retire from&lt;br /&gt;
the company; they, therefore, after partaking of&lt;br /&gt;
the wedding feast, withdrew, except the friends&lt;br /&gt;
of the parties, who were detained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day Albert came at the appointed&lt;br /&gt;
hour, and was received again into Eliza’s apart-&lt;br /&gt;
ment, with her parents only. Her father then&lt;br /&gt;
told him that they were ready to hear any expla-&lt;br /&gt;
nation or communication he wished to make.–&lt;br /&gt;
Albert informed them, that after he had accom-&lt;br /&gt;
plished his business in England, he set sail for&lt;br /&gt;
America; the second day after which they were ta-&lt;br /&gt;
ken by an Algerine corsair, carried to Algiers,&lt;br /&gt;
and sold for slaves. Some of the ship’s crew&lt;br /&gt;
were redeemed, others died in slavery: Albert&lt;br /&gt;
and four more were chained to the gallies, where&lt;br /&gt;
they continued for upwards of eighteen months;&lt;br /&gt;
it happened that they were then driven off the&lt;br /&gt;
sea coast in a storm, and picked up by a French&lt;br /&gt;
vessel, which carried them, and the two Turks&lt;br /&gt;
who were their overseers, to Bordeaux, from&lt;br /&gt;
whence Albert took passage on board a merchant-&lt;br /&gt;
man for America.–This was the ship which Eli-&lt;br /&gt;
za saw coming into port, the preceding after-&lt;br /&gt;
noon; it arrived in the evening, and Albert, as&lt;br /&gt;
soon as he came on shore, went directly to the&lt;br /&gt;
house which formerly belonged to his father, and&lt;br /&gt;
found it unoccupied: he called at one of the&lt;br /&gt;
neighbors, who informed him of the circumstan-&lt;br /&gt;
ces of his family, his father’s death, his mother’s&lt;br /&gt;
removal, and the celebration of Eliza’s wedding&lt;br /&gt;
that evening: almost in a state of distraction, he&lt;br /&gt;
hastened to the house; his arrival there, and what&lt;br /&gt;
ensued in consequence thereof, is already known.&lt;br /&gt;
Eliza then mentioned what the stranger had re-&lt;br /&gt;
lated at her uncle’s, when he delivered Blake the&lt;br /&gt;
letter, and what she heard at the milliner’s.&lt;br /&gt;
These circumstances Albert was enabled to ex-&lt;br /&gt;
plain. A distant relation of his father, and of&lt;br /&gt;
the same name, who lived on Staten-Island, had&lt;br /&gt;
put in his claim, and obtained part of the in-&lt;br /&gt;
heritance which fell to Albert; a young man of&lt;br /&gt;
about Albert’s age, was the person sent over to&lt;br /&gt;
claim the property, who had married to a fortune&lt;br /&gt;
in London, and his father’s family had removed&lt;br /&gt;
to Long Island some time before the stranger’s&lt;br /&gt;
arrival at New-York, who brought the letter, and&lt;br /&gt;
the intelligence which had given Eliza so much&lt;br /&gt;
uneasiness. The father of the young man had&lt;br /&gt;
died, after removing to Long-Island, which&lt;br /&gt;
coincided with the milliner’s story. Albert had&lt;br /&gt;
mentioned this circumstance in his letter to his&lt;br /&gt;
father; he had written to his friends but once,&lt;br /&gt;
which was just before he sat out to return, af-&lt;br /&gt;
ter which he had not another opportunity.&lt;br /&gt;
Blake was now called in. A cold and distant&lt;br /&gt;
salutation passed between him and Albert. The&lt;br /&gt;
circumstances were particularly related to him,&lt;br /&gt;
and his opinion requested. He replied, that the&lt;br /&gt;
decision must rest, solely, with Eliza; he was&lt;br /&gt;
not, himself, so mad as to desire a connection with&lt;br /&gt;
a person whose affections were placed upon ano-&lt;br /&gt;
ther. A question then arose, whether the mar-&lt;br /&gt;
riage ceremony had not been so far executed, be-&lt;br /&gt;
tween Eliza and Blake, as to become legally&lt;br /&gt;
binding. The officiating clergyman was sent&lt;br /&gt;
for, who gave it as his opinion, that although&lt;br /&gt;
the ceremony was not fully completed, yet, so&lt;br /&gt;
far that he considered them really and firmly mar-&lt;br /&gt;
ried. He advised, however, to send for the cler-&lt;br /&gt;
gy of the city, to consult upon the affair. This&lt;br /&gt;
was agreed upon, and two days after they were&lt;br /&gt;
convened at the house of Eliza’s father. The&lt;br /&gt;
parties and their friends were present at the con-&lt;br /&gt;
sultation, the result of which was, that nothing&lt;br /&gt;
except death or divorcement could separate Blake&lt;br /&gt;
and Eliza. Just as this decision was given in, a&lt;br /&gt;
woman was announced, who desired to be admit-&lt;br /&gt;
ted before the convocation. She was immediate-&lt;br /&gt;
ly introduced–it was Miss Smith!–Blake was&lt;br /&gt;
agitated, and changed colour upon seeing her; she&lt;br /&gt;
desired to be heard by the convocation, when the&lt;br /&gt;
following circumstances were unfolded.&lt;br /&gt;
Blake’s father, who was a nobleman, had been&lt;br /&gt;
illicitly connected with a woman of family in a&lt;br /&gt;
remote part of England, by whom he had two&lt;br /&gt;
children, one son and a daughter. He afterwards&lt;br /&gt;
married in London, but never had any other child&lt;br /&gt;
by his wife except Blake, who, like the sons of&lt;br /&gt;
noblemen in general, proved to be a wild youth.&lt;br /&gt;
In making the fashionable tour of Europe, he be-&lt;br /&gt;
came acquainted with a lady in Italy, whom he&lt;br /&gt;
married. His father, indulgent to him in all&lt;br /&gt;
things, sanctioned the marriage; but what was&lt;br /&gt;
his astonishment when, on Blake’s bringing home&lt;br /&gt;
his lady, his father found her to be his own daugh-&lt;br /&gt;
ter, by the woman before mentioned, who had re-&lt;br /&gt;
tired to Italy, where she died, leaving her two&lt;br /&gt;
children, with all her property, which was consid-&lt;br /&gt;
erable, to the care of a distant relation. This&lt;br /&gt;
daughter, who was now the wife of Blake, was&lt;br /&gt;
Miss Smith! To save the reputation of the fam-&lt;br /&gt;
ily, their father projected sending them to Ame-&lt;br /&gt;
rica, until a separation could be legally obtained;&lt;br /&gt;
he however died before this plan could be put in&lt;br /&gt;
execution, and Blake came over to America with&lt;br /&gt;
his kinsman the Governor, as has been related;&lt;br /&gt;
the Governor, however, knew nothing of the af-&lt;br /&gt;
fair. Miss Smith soon followed, where they wai-&lt;br /&gt;
ted, under fictitious names, for the interference&lt;br /&gt;
of some friends in England, to obtain a dissolu-&lt;br /&gt;
tion of the marriage, which had not yet been&lt;br /&gt;
done. Miss Smith had not seen her brother since&lt;br /&gt;
he was quite a youth when he went to live with&lt;br /&gt;
a friend at Paris. At parting they had exchang-&lt;br /&gt;
ed miniature likenesses, solemnly engaging never&lt;br /&gt;
to part with them till death. After Miss Smith’s&lt;br /&gt;
arrived at New-York, she resided with a relation&lt;br /&gt;
of her mother, who knew nothing of her history.&lt;br /&gt;
From the moment that Blake and she discovered&lt;br /&gt;
their affinity, they broke off all connection; yet&lt;br /&gt;
Miss Smith could never realize the brother in the&lt;br /&gt;
lover;–hence she had endeavoured to frustrate&lt;br /&gt;
his alliance with Eliza. She even acknowledged&lt;br /&gt;
that she designedly pushed her from the barge, as&lt;br /&gt;
has been mentioned, with an intent to drown her;&lt;br /&gt;
for if she could consent to live in a state of sepa-&lt;br /&gt;
ration, she could not submit to his connecting&lt;br /&gt;
with another. By his persuasion, she had yielded&lt;br /&gt;
to retire to Jersey; there she became acquainted&lt;br /&gt;
with a gentleman who boarded at the house where&lt;br /&gt;
she resided. One day, as they were walking to-&lt;br /&gt;
gether, a miniature fell from his bosom, which&lt;br /&gt;
she immediately knew to be her own likeness.–&lt;br /&gt;
Surprised and amazed, she desired to know how&lt;br /&gt;
he came by it: he informed her that it once be-&lt;br /&gt;
longed to a friend, who was now no more, and&lt;br /&gt;
who, shortly before his death, deposited it with&lt;br /&gt;
him. Miss Smith then told him that this person&lt;br /&gt;
could have been no other than her brother. This&lt;br /&gt;
led to an explanation, by which it was found that&lt;br /&gt;
Palmer, who fell in the duel with Blake, was the&lt;br /&gt;
brother of Miss Smith, and the son of Blake’s&lt;br /&gt;
father! and the person who now had the minia-&lt;br /&gt;
ture in his possession, was Palmer’s second in that&lt;br /&gt;
duel. Palmer had come over from France, and&lt;br /&gt;
resided at New-York, under a feigned name.–&lt;br /&gt;
Supposing his sister in Italy, he had no idea of&lt;br /&gt;
her appearing in New-York, in the person of&lt;br /&gt;
Miss Smith. Palmer was so much altered from&lt;br /&gt;
the miniature which she still had with her, that&lt;br /&gt;
although she saw him frequently, she had not the&lt;br /&gt;
least suggestion of his being her brother. On her&lt;br /&gt;
discovering the melancholy circumstances of his&lt;br /&gt;
death, she left her retreat in New-Jersey, and&lt;br /&gt;
hastened to New-York, where she arrived about&lt;br /&gt;
the time that the clerical gentlemen were sent&lt;br /&gt;
for, to consult upon the validity of the marriage&lt;br /&gt;
between Eliza and Blake. She immediately took&lt;br /&gt;
the resolution of proceeding to Long-Island, and&lt;br /&gt;
laying the whole affair before the parties, and the&lt;br /&gt;
clerical convocation; and although she thereby&lt;br /&gt;
involved her own character, yet she should do a&lt;br /&gt;
peculiar service to the innocent.—-This Miss&lt;br /&gt;
Smith gave as the ostensible reason, but her prin-&lt;br /&gt;
cipal design was to prevent Blake’s connection&lt;br /&gt;
with Eliza.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the close of this narration, the whole assem-&lt;br /&gt;
bly was filled with amazement, and looked upon&lt;br /&gt;
each other with astonishment. Blake shuddered&lt;br /&gt;
with horror. He knew that Miss Smith had a&lt;br /&gt;
brother, whom he had never seen, but he never&lt;br /&gt;
heard a suggestion that this brother was Palmer.&lt;br /&gt;
His emotions became insupportable. He had&lt;br /&gt;
unconsciously married his sister; unknowingly&lt;br /&gt;
slain his brother, and was now totally disappoint-&lt;br /&gt;
ed in the only object of his future felicity. He&lt;br /&gt;
hastily arose from his seat—distraction had seized&lt;br /&gt;
upon his brain–he cast a wild dispairing look&lt;br /&gt;
around him, and rushed out at the door. In a&lt;br /&gt;
few minutes the report of a pistol was heard in&lt;br /&gt;
his chamber, the people ran up stairs; his door&lt;br /&gt;
was locked; they burst it open; he lay dead up-&lt;br /&gt;
on the floor! The ball had pierced his temples,&lt;br /&gt;
and he, probably, expired without a struggle.–&lt;br /&gt;
Thus died a man of whom it may, with propriety, be&lt;br /&gt;
said, was &lt;em&gt;innocently&lt;/em&gt; guilty of offences at which&lt;br /&gt;
human nature revolts with terror, and who, per-&lt;br /&gt;
haps, had never been conscious of a single act&lt;br /&gt;
which is generally denominated criminal. He&lt;br /&gt;
possessed a noble, brave, and generous spirit; but&lt;br /&gt;
the evil torrent of life bore too heavily upon him,&lt;br /&gt;
and he fell a victim to the wayward and irresistable&lt;br /&gt;
decrees of fate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some time after this, Albert and Eliza married:&lt;br /&gt;
he had deposited the property which he had ob-&lt;br /&gt;
tained in the English fund, which he now wrote&lt;br /&gt;
for, and received. They then took leave of the&lt;br /&gt;
place where these scenes were transacted; they&lt;br /&gt;
removed on to the main, a considerable distance&lt;br /&gt;
up Connecticut River, where they settled in an&lt;br /&gt;
unfrequented part of the country. Albert sent for&lt;br /&gt;
his mother, who with tears of joy was received&lt;br /&gt;
by her children, Albert and Eliza. There they&lt;br /&gt;
passed their days, in as much happiness as this in-&lt;br /&gt;
constant and dissatisfactory life will permit.—-&lt;br /&gt;
Their descendants were people of respectability,&lt;br /&gt;
some of whom have held important offices under&lt;br /&gt;
the government, others have been members of the&lt;br /&gt;
legislature of Connecticut, and one of them has&lt;br /&gt;
been honoured with a seat in the American Con-&lt;br /&gt;
gress. The facts above related, have long been&lt;br /&gt;
forgotten, except by the descendants of the fami-&lt;br /&gt;
ly, or some person to whom those descendants&lt;br /&gt;
have related them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[It will readily be perceived that the foregoing&lt;br /&gt;
narrative is designed only as a delineation, or has-&lt;br /&gt;
ty sketch of that which, if in the hands of some&lt;br /&gt;
person of leisure and abilities, might be made an&lt;br /&gt;
interesting history. Should BROWN, the Ameri-&lt;br /&gt;
can novelist, or some other person possessing equal&lt;br /&gt;
powers of tale and invention, take up the subject,&lt;br /&gt;
he might, by the introduction of a few new cha-&lt;br /&gt;
racters, transferment of objects, and variation of&lt;br /&gt;
scenery, form, perhaps, as interesting a novel as&lt;br /&gt;
any of American manufacture.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Early American Serialized Novels</name></author><summary type="html">On This Page</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Adventures In A Castle</title><link href="https://earlyamericanserializednovels.github.io/adventures-in-a-castle/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Adventures In A Castle" /><published>1801-05-02T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>1801-05-02T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://earlyamericanserializednovels.github.io/adventures-in-a-castle</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://earlyamericanserializednovels.github.io/adventures-in-a-castle/">&lt;nav class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preface&quot;&gt;Preface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adventures in a Castle&lt;/em&gt; was published initially in eight serialized installments in the &lt;em&gt;Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register&lt;/em&gt;. The first of the work’s eight installments was printed on May 2nd, 1801, and its publication continued weekly through June 30 of that same year. The editor, David Hogan, was responsible for the serialization and inclusion of &lt;em&gt;Adventures in a Castle&lt;/em&gt; in the magazine. The vast extent of what is known about the author is shared in the paratext Hogan includes in its serialized publication. Hogan references the author Julius a total of seven times. Typically these references are just by name and appear at the conclusion of an installment. However, at the end of the story, Hogan divulges some interesting views and revealing contextualized interpretation of the tale in the concluding paratext.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to his gratitude for the author Julius’ timely submissions, Hogan admits in the final reference that “the literary world abounds with the trifles of this kind.” Hogan goes on to suggest that consequently “no doubt [works like this one], in some measure, forms a criterion by which to judge of the taste of the age; tho’ a taste of this kind of reading, is not, perhaps, peculiar to the present one.” Essentially, what Hogan concedes is that while this tale is not extraordinary in and of itself, it does delineate the general expectation readers of that age upheld.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tales like &lt;em&gt;Adventures in a Castle&lt;/em&gt;, as Hogan suggests “inculcate…a moral, if not new, yet good.” In this story, Hogan maintains the Count de Vauban, who is avarice personified, “meets with the deserved punishment: while the innocent objects of his horrid persecution, are extricated from his cruel fangs, and finally brought to the enjoyment of more perfect domestic felicity, than they would otherwise probably have attained, had it not been for those very circumstances to which his machinations gave birth.” This particular outcome not only conforms to reader expectation but it does so because it corroborates an espoused or at least perceived divine truth of the period that “the wicked are often snared in their own devices.” Hogan concludes with his praise of Julius’ prose and his ability to refrain from “those passionate exclamations, that often insinuate a degree of profanity into the mind, and with which tales and novels frequently abound.” He insinuates to the reader that any new works Julius may choose to submit will be given the utmost consideration from the editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Julius is credited with a few additional serialized works and literary appearances that emerged at different times in the &lt;em&gt;Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register&lt;/em&gt;. In a letter to the editor, on October 17 1801, Julius bemoans the behavior of two primary correspondents over the issue of Mr. Law and the Uranian Society. In the April 2 1803 publication Julius addresses the periodical’s editor David Hogan through paratext interjected before the poem “Epitaph” urging his readership to help solve an apparent chronological inconsistency in the work. In one of the earliest submissions on April 4 1801, Julius, in the short fictional work “Curious Incident,” patterns much of what he accomplishes later in &lt;em&gt;Adventures in a Castle&lt;/em&gt; through his construction of this demonstrable moralistic tale. The final reference of Julius is the serialized work entitled &lt;em&gt;The Ruins&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;The Ruins&lt;/em&gt; is a similarly moralistic tale that was serialized into six installments beginning on November 28, 1801 and finishing on the January 16, 1802.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As its name suggests, the &lt;em&gt;Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register&lt;/em&gt; was printed in the early nineteenth century in Philadelphia. The publication was printed in quarto form, a book or pamphlet composed of one or more sheets of paper on which eight pages are printed, which are then folded twice over to create four “leaves.” During its five-and-a-half-year existence from November 15, 1800 to April 5, 1806, the &lt;em&gt;Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register&lt;/em&gt; was edited by David Hogan, John W. Scott, and ultimately Thomas Irwin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This eight-page weekly publication included an assortment of miscellaneous subjects, matters, and content that were composed in a diverse range of forms including: original essays, serialized tales, extracts from both new and older publications, biographical sketches, and some material on the theater. According to the &lt;em&gt;History of Philadelphia&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;Philadelphia Repository and Weekly Register&lt;/em&gt; was popular because it was “edited with a kind spirit of encouragement towards their experiments in writing, and offered a place for their poetry, tales, and sketches, upon terms of criticism not very strict or severe.” Interestingly, the majority of issues often included musical compositions, and during the period of time when Hogan and Scott oversaw the periodical’s publication, the final page was dedicated almost exclusively to poetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each of the narrative’s serialized excerpts are contained in the periodical’s first volume in consecutive issues twenty-five through thirty-two.&lt;em&gt;Adventures in a Castle&lt;/em&gt; was also reprinted and featured in the &lt;em&gt;New-York Weekly Museum&lt;/em&gt;. It appeared in six installments beginning on January 2 and ending on the February 6, 1808. It is interesting to consider just how much the readability of the text is impacted by the two different serializations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Adventures in a Castle&lt;/em&gt;, in its initial eight-installment-serialization were shorter, so out of necessity, the “new” breaks in the two serialized publications must necessarily be evaluated to determine impact. There is no question that the flow of the narrative is changed by the alterations of the second serialized publication, but not knowing exactly who the author is nor if they had completed the entirety of the work prior to its first serialization with a specifically intended form for publication invites a great deal of supposition that is difficult to definitively conclude. Audience, and the organization and publication of the magazine also play a key factors in evaluating the serial’s readability. Changes between serializations are not just limited to form, even the title changed with the second serial. The work was no longer entitled merely &lt;em&gt;Adventures in a Castle&lt;/em&gt; but another optional title was inserted—&lt;em&gt;The Two Brothers&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New-York Weekly Museum&lt;/em&gt; was a four-page magazine intended largely for a female readership. It was characterized as a “polite repository of amusement and instruction; being an assemblage of whatever can interest the mind, or exalt the character of the American fair.” Much of the content was of a sentimental and moral nature and included fictional romances that were frequently serialized. Additionally, the magazine included other various written forms like poetry, anecdotes, a morality column, theatrical reviews, domestic and foreign news, as well as advertisements. The publication run of NYWM spanned over a decade from 1805-1817.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adventures in a Castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An Original Story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PREVIOUS to the revolution which&lt;br /&gt;
has convulsed Europe, and before peace&lt;br /&gt;
and order were banished from the bosom&lt;br /&gt;
of France, lived Monsieur Boileau. His&lt;br /&gt;
chateau was situated on the border of a&lt;br /&gt;
small stream which glided through a roman-&lt;br /&gt;
tic valley in the province of Burgundy.&lt;br /&gt;
He had formerly resided in the capital, and&lt;br /&gt;
had ever borne an unblemished character;&lt;br /&gt;
but having the misfortune of being bereft&lt;br /&gt;
of the partner of his felicity, he purchased&lt;br /&gt;
this small spot, to which he retired, accom-&lt;br /&gt;
panied by his two sons, Louis and Henry,&lt;br /&gt;
neither of them of an age capable of feel-&lt;br /&gt;
ing the severity of their loss: Louis the eld-&lt;br /&gt;
est being but thirteen, and his brother two&lt;br /&gt;
years younger. Monsieur Boileau here&lt;br /&gt;
employed the principle part of his time in&lt;br /&gt;
instructing his two children in every branch&lt;br /&gt;
of science, and with pleasure observed the&lt;br /&gt;
progress they made in their studies, and&lt;br /&gt;
the justice of their observations on the va-&lt;br /&gt;
rious authors, whose works he had sub-&lt;br /&gt;
mitted to their perusal. Several years had&lt;br /&gt;
passed away, and the two brothers had&lt;br /&gt;
nearly attained the age of maturity, when&lt;br /&gt;
the hand of death deprived them of their&lt;br /&gt;
father: sincere was their grief on this oc-&lt;br /&gt;
casion, for they had always loved him with&lt;br /&gt;
the fondest affection. On his death-bed&lt;br /&gt;
he committed them to the care of his friend&lt;br /&gt;
Monsieur Dupont, then an inhabitant of&lt;br /&gt;
Dijon, the capital of the province, who&lt;br /&gt;
received the weeping orphans with tender-&lt;br /&gt;
ness, sympathized with their sorrows, and&lt;br /&gt;
soothed their afflictions, by his kind atten-&lt;br /&gt;
tion. It may not be amiss here to observe,&lt;br /&gt;
that Monsieur Boileau was a descendant of&lt;br /&gt;
a noble house, and that if he had survived&lt;br /&gt;
his brother the Count de Vauban, he would&lt;br /&gt;
have inherited his title, therefore Louis&lt;br /&gt;
his eldest son, became the heir apparent&lt;br /&gt;
of his uncle: between the Count and his&lt;br /&gt;
brother a difference had long subsisted, and&lt;br /&gt;
which was not terminated by the death of&lt;br /&gt;
the latter, but the enmity was continu-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to his innocent nephews; though as&lt;br /&gt;
his brother had left a very considerable for-&lt;br /&gt;
tune, and his own was too small to support&lt;br /&gt;
his extravagance, he pretended to entertain&lt;br /&gt;
a great affection for them, that he might&lt;br /&gt;
have an opportunity of executing his vil-&lt;br /&gt;
lainous designs. Monsieur Dupont, whom&lt;br /&gt;
his friend Boileau, appointed guardian of&lt;br /&gt;
his children, was a gentleman who had too&lt;br /&gt;
great an acquaintance with the world and&lt;br /&gt;
its arts, to suffer himself to be deceived by&lt;br /&gt;
a specious appearance, he therefore min-&lt;br /&gt;
utely noticed the Count’s conduct, and act-&lt;br /&gt;
ed with caution in any thing with which&lt;br /&gt;
he was concerned. Shortly after the young&lt;br /&gt;
Boileau’s were numbered amongst the&lt;br /&gt;
family, Dupont removed to his country&lt;br /&gt;
seat: it was a large house, and it appeared&lt;br /&gt;
as if it had stood for centuries, by the ru-&lt;br /&gt;
inous condition of many parts of it. It had&lt;br /&gt;
been bequeathed to him by a distant rela-&lt;br /&gt;
tion in its present state; by admiring the&lt;br /&gt;
grandeur of its situation, and the beautiful&lt;br /&gt;
scenery which surrounded it, he had resolv-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to spare no expense in making it suita-&lt;br /&gt;
ble to receive his family, during the sum-&lt;br /&gt;
mer months. He had therefore repaired&lt;br /&gt;
the north wing of the building, and deter-&lt;br /&gt;
mined to refit the whole in the ensuing year.&lt;br /&gt;
This spot they made their retreat, and. were&lt;br /&gt;
frequently visited by the Count de Vauban,&lt;br /&gt;
who would often spend whole weeks with&lt;br /&gt;
them.&lt;br /&gt;
But this seeming friendship for his&lt;br /&gt;
nephews did not lull the watchfulness of&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Dupont, and frequently while tracing&lt;br /&gt;
the various avenues to the southern wing&lt;br /&gt;
of the house, he would perceive himself&lt;br /&gt;
carefully followed, by the scrutinizing&lt;br /&gt;
eye of the faithful guardian. Although he&lt;br /&gt;
was sensible that he was the object of the&lt;br /&gt;
suspicion of Monsieur Dupont, yet it did&lt;br /&gt;
not deter him from contriving further plans&lt;br /&gt;
to deprive his nephews of their estate. One&lt;br /&gt;
night Henry, the youngest, complained of&lt;br /&gt;
a slight indisposition, and retired unusually&lt;br /&gt;
early to bed; at breakfast hour the next&lt;br /&gt;
morning he had not appeared, which his&lt;br /&gt;
guardian attributed to his not having rested&lt;br /&gt;
well the preceding night, owing to his trif-&lt;br /&gt;
ling illness, but when the dinner-bell rung,&lt;br /&gt;
and he had not been seen, he became se-&lt;br /&gt;
riously alarmed for his safety, and instant-&lt;br /&gt;
ly attended by Louis, entered his chamber,&lt;br /&gt;
when to their astonishment, he was not&lt;br /&gt;
to be found. To conjecture where he was,&lt;br /&gt;
orby what unaccountable manner he had&lt;br /&gt;
disappeared, was almost impossible, but&lt;br /&gt;
all the supposition that could be entertain-&lt;br /&gt;
ed by Mr. Dupont was, that it had been&lt;br /&gt;
effected by foul means, and the suspicion&lt;br /&gt;
of the deed rested on the Count, who had&lt;br /&gt;
departed early on the morning. Thus did&lt;br /&gt;
they remain, when the idea presented it-&lt;br /&gt;
self to the mind of Mr. Dupont that pro-&lt;br /&gt;
bably some of the servants had been pre-&lt;br /&gt;
vailed upon by the Count to poison their&lt;br /&gt;
food, and that though himself and Louis&lt;br /&gt;
had escaped, yet Henry might have fallen&lt;br /&gt;
a victim to the plot, and had been removed&lt;br /&gt;
in the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2. 9 May 1801]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Continued.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE moment he suggested the thought,&lt;br /&gt;
he ordered all the servants to be assembled&lt;br /&gt;
in the hall, but all firmly protesting, that&lt;br /&gt;
they were innocent, and no proofs of guilt&lt;br /&gt;
appearing, they were discharged. What&lt;br /&gt;
confirms this unanimous declaration, and&lt;br /&gt;
contradicted his former opinion, was the&lt;br /&gt;
door being locked within, and the height&lt;br /&gt;
of the chamber from the ground so great,&lt;br /&gt;
that it appeared to be impossible to ap-&lt;br /&gt;
proach it from without. Another circum-&lt;br /&gt;
stance happened soon after this unaccount-&lt;br /&gt;
able disappearance, which filled the breast&lt;br /&gt;
of Monsieur Dupont with alarm, and tend-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to strengthen the suspicion he had en-&lt;br /&gt;
tertained of the Count’s being concerned&lt;br /&gt;
in the transaction. Louis returning one&lt;br /&gt;
evening from Dijon, meditating on the&lt;br /&gt;
strange accident which had so deeply af-&lt;br /&gt;
flicted him, rode on before his attendants:&lt;br /&gt;
but he had not proceeded far, when he was&lt;br /&gt;
assaulted by six armed ruffians. He de-&lt;br /&gt;
fended himself with such dexterity and&lt;br /&gt;
resolution, that when his servants came&lt;br /&gt;
to his assistance they found one of the vil-&lt;br /&gt;
lains lifeless at his feet, the others having&lt;br /&gt;
fled at their approach. The wounds he&lt;br /&gt;
received in this encounter confined him to&lt;br /&gt;
the house for several weeks: and when he&lt;br /&gt;
was restored to health Monsieur Dupont,&lt;br /&gt;
sensible that the safety of the son of his&lt;br /&gt;
deceased friend depended on his removal&lt;br /&gt;
to another part of the kingdom, private-&lt;br /&gt;
ly departed for the chateau of Monsieur&lt;br /&gt;
Boileau. The family of Dupont, which&lt;br /&gt;
consisted of himself, his wife and daugh-&lt;br /&gt;
ter, willingly relinquished the pleasures of&lt;br /&gt;
society in favour of Louis, for his engaging&lt;br /&gt;
behaviour had so won their regard, that&lt;br /&gt;
there was no gratification which they&lt;br /&gt;
would not yield when put in competition&lt;br /&gt;
with his safety. His pleasures were here&lt;br /&gt;
embittered by the recollection of many&lt;br /&gt;
painful scenes, and his imagination paint-&lt;br /&gt;
ed in lively colours the happiness he had&lt;br /&gt;
once enjoyed on this spot, in the society&lt;br /&gt;
of his father and brother.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not far distant from their present resi-&lt;br /&gt;
dence stood an old castle, the seat of Mon-&lt;br /&gt;
sieur Boileau’s ancestors, now in the pos-&lt;br /&gt;
session of the Count de Vauban; this place&lt;br /&gt;
young Louis had frequently wished to ex-&lt;br /&gt;
amine when a child, but the dusky ap-&lt;br /&gt;
pearance of the whole, had prevented the&lt;br /&gt;
gratification of his curiosity. Monsieur&lt;br /&gt;
Dupont beheld with concern the melancho-&lt;br /&gt;
ly that had taken possession of the mind of&lt;br /&gt;
his young ward, and in order to divert his&lt;br /&gt;
attention, proposed that they should ex-&lt;br /&gt;
plore together the recesses of the castle.&lt;br /&gt;
To this Louis readily assented, and they&lt;br /&gt;
set out early one morning for that purpose,&lt;br /&gt;
unattended. They intended entering by&lt;br /&gt;
the gateway, but their passage was ob-&lt;br /&gt;
structed by the stones which had fallen&lt;br /&gt;
from the battlements, and they were obli-&lt;br /&gt;
ged to seek another entrance, which they&lt;br /&gt;
soon found in a low door leading to the&lt;br /&gt;
foot of a staircase: this they ascended, and&lt;br /&gt;
found themselves in the apartments allotted&lt;br /&gt;
to the servants. Through these they pas-&lt;br /&gt;
sed into a large gallery, which still contained a&lt;br /&gt;
number of beautiful pictures. Louis, who&lt;br /&gt;
was extremely fond of painting, remained&lt;br /&gt;
to take a narrower view of them, while&lt;br /&gt;
Monsieur Dupont advanced farther in the&lt;br /&gt;
castle. He had not proceeded far, before&lt;br /&gt;
he heard the murmur of voices approaching&lt;br /&gt;
in an opposite direction to the portrait&lt;br /&gt;
gallery, where he had left Louis, and he&lt;br /&gt;
immediately after perceived two men ap-&lt;br /&gt;
parently engaged in a very interesting con-&lt;br /&gt;
versation, but the subject of it remained&lt;br /&gt;
unknown to him, as they descended a flight&lt;br /&gt;
of steps at some distance before him. Sur-&lt;br /&gt;
prised at their appearance, he hastily return-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to Louis, and acquainted him with what&lt;br /&gt;
he had seen, telling him they would come&lt;br /&gt;
in the afternoon with a few servants armed,&lt;br /&gt;
in order to penetrate the mystery, as the&lt;br /&gt;
castle had always been considered as un-&lt;br /&gt;
inhabited. To the chateau they accord-&lt;br /&gt;
ingly went, and when they had dined,&lt;br /&gt;
they loaded their pistols and set out, ac-&lt;br /&gt;
companied by James, Louis’s valet, and&lt;br /&gt;
five others on whom they could depend.&lt;br /&gt;
They passed into the castle by the same&lt;br /&gt;
way as before, and entered a narrow&lt;br /&gt;
winding passage, which seemed to extend&lt;br /&gt;
along the whole of the building: following&lt;br /&gt;
this they reached a spiral staircase, that&lt;br /&gt;
they descended, and on the first floor below&lt;br /&gt;
they perceived that they were at the junc-&lt;br /&gt;
tion of the branches of a large entry. Here&lt;br /&gt;
they hesitated, not knowing which to&lt;br /&gt;
pursue, when they heard the sound of a&lt;br /&gt;
distant footstep behind them. They instant-&lt;br /&gt;
ly secreted themselves, and immediately&lt;br /&gt;
perceived a man pass by without noticing&lt;br /&gt;
them. He was soon met by another, and&lt;br /&gt;
a dialogue ensued, which was not con-&lt;br /&gt;
ducted on so low a key but that they were&lt;br /&gt;
overheard. “Gerald,” said the first, who&lt;br /&gt;
appeared to have some authority, “the&lt;br /&gt;
prisoner’s fate is now determined, and he&lt;br /&gt;
must be dispatched as expeditiously as&lt;br /&gt;
possible.” “Why,” replied the other,&lt;br /&gt;
is this sudden resolution? I thought it was&lt;br /&gt;
not to have been done.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“No matter,” answered the first, “do&lt;br /&gt;
you see it is done; I am in haste: when&lt;br /&gt;
it is finished, prepare to the grand hall.”&lt;br /&gt;
Upon this they separated, and walked down&lt;br /&gt;
different avenues. When they had got a&lt;br /&gt;
considerable distance, it was resolved that&lt;br /&gt;
Louis, his valet, and another servant, should&lt;br /&gt;
follow the second, while Monsieur Dupont&lt;br /&gt;
and the remainder should pursue the first.&lt;br /&gt;
Louis and his small party proceeded after&lt;br /&gt;
Gerald with great caution, till he entered&lt;br /&gt;
a small chamber: They remained within&lt;br /&gt;
sight of the door for nearly an hour, when&lt;br /&gt;
finding he did not return, they ventured&lt;br /&gt;
to look into the room, where they perceive-&lt;br /&gt;
ed he had passed through an opposite&lt;br /&gt;
door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vexed at being thus disappointed, Louis&lt;br /&gt;
rushed hastily forward, and had soon ad-&lt;br /&gt;
vanced considerably before his companions,&lt;br /&gt;
when he perceived the same man striking&lt;br /&gt;
a light. As soon as he had succeeded, he&lt;br /&gt;
proceeded till he reached a stair-case,&lt;br /&gt;
when he began to descend. Louis, desirous&lt;br /&gt;
of rescuing the unknown prisoner from the&lt;br /&gt;
murderous designs of his enemies, contin-&lt;br /&gt;
ued to follow the man, whom he now saw&lt;br /&gt;
was armed, till at length he was assured&lt;br /&gt;
by the dampness of the air and the dim&lt;br /&gt;
glimmering of the light which Gerald car-&lt;br /&gt;
ried in his hand, that he was in the vaults&lt;br /&gt;
of the castle. JULIUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3. 16 May 1801]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Continued.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Undaunted by the certainty that he was&lt;br /&gt;
at a great distance from his companions, he&lt;br /&gt;
persisted in his resolute undertaking, and&lt;br /&gt;
grasping a brace of pistols, with cautious&lt;br /&gt;
steps pursued the assassin (who had by this&lt;br /&gt;
time ceased to descend,) thro’ the winding&lt;br /&gt;
avenues of the subterranean apartments,&lt;br /&gt;
when he suddenly fell through a trap door&lt;br /&gt;
into the vault below. Here he remained&lt;br /&gt;
a considerable time senseless from the&lt;br /&gt;
fall; one of the pistols, which he had held in his&lt;br /&gt;
hand was discharged, and the report rever-&lt;br /&gt;
berating from the gloomy cavities, vibrated&lt;br /&gt;
on the ear of the astonish’d Gerald with&lt;br /&gt;
such an awful sound, that he remained&lt;br /&gt;
almost lifeless with terror. When reason&lt;br /&gt;
had resumed her functions over his mind,&lt;br /&gt;
he removed himself as fast as his trembling&lt;br /&gt;
limbs would bear him, from the spot which&lt;br /&gt;
had inspired him with such dreadful appre-&lt;br /&gt;
hensions, unable to comprehend from what&lt;br /&gt;
cause they had arisen. While Gerald was&lt;br /&gt;
proceeding to execute his diabolical pur-&lt;br /&gt;
pose, far other sensations pervaded the&lt;br /&gt;
breast of Louis: providentially he had not&lt;br /&gt;
received any material injury, and when he&lt;br /&gt;
had recovered from the swoon into which&lt;br /&gt;
his fall had thrown him, he arose disappoint-&lt;br /&gt;
ed, because he now believed himself inca-&lt;br /&gt;
pable of preventing the accomplishment of&lt;br /&gt;
Gerald’s murderous designs on the un-&lt;br /&gt;
known victim. Picturing to himself some&lt;br /&gt;
unfortunate man fallen into the hands of&lt;br /&gt;
his enemies, and suffering under the dagger&lt;br /&gt;
of the nightly assassin, he paced with has-&lt;br /&gt;
ty steps, the cavern into which he had&lt;br /&gt;
been thrown, when a deep groan assail’d&lt;br /&gt;
his ear. His first sensation was an invol-&lt;br /&gt;
untary emotion of fear, but listening for&lt;br /&gt;
some minutes attentively, and not hearing&lt;br /&gt;
it repeated, he attributed it to his perturb-&lt;br /&gt;
ed imagination.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some minutes had elapsed it was&lt;br /&gt;
repeated, and he heard it too distinctly to&lt;br /&gt;
suffer him to consider it as the wanderings&lt;br /&gt;
of his own disordered fancy. Advancing&lt;br /&gt;
towards the place from whence the sound&lt;br /&gt;
proceeded, he perceived the reflection of a&lt;br /&gt;
light proceeding from an iron grate, and&lt;br /&gt;
which upon a nearer view he found was&lt;br /&gt;
placed upon a small table in the adjoining&lt;br /&gt;
vault. Near it was a man in chains, ly-&lt;br /&gt;
ing on a miserable bed of straw, from whom&lt;br /&gt;
the groans which had alarmed him issued.&lt;br /&gt;
He had scarcely reached the grate when&lt;br /&gt;
an opposite door opened, and Gerald, the&lt;br /&gt;
same whom he had followed so long, enter-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the vault. Louis had one pistol charg-&lt;br /&gt;
ed, and that he determined to use in the&lt;br /&gt;
preservation of the helpless sufferer, and&lt;br /&gt;
as the assassin was preparing to execute his&lt;br /&gt;
infamous purpose, he exclaimed,–“Infer-&lt;br /&gt;
nal instrument of tyranny, go to that world&lt;br /&gt;
where thy black soul shall suffer torments&lt;br /&gt;
worthy of so foul a miscreant,” and at the&lt;br /&gt;
same moment Gerald received a ball in his&lt;br /&gt;
breast from the hand of Louis. Roused by&lt;br /&gt;
the noise from a broken slumber, the pri-&lt;br /&gt;
soner raised himself from the floor, and pre-&lt;br /&gt;
sented to the eye of the astonished Louis&lt;br /&gt;
the ghastly countenance &lt;em&gt;of his brother Hen&lt;/em&gt;-&lt;br /&gt;
ry. Joy at once more beholding those be-&lt;br /&gt;
loved features, inspired him strength, and&lt;br /&gt;
grasping the bars with a nervous hand, he&lt;br /&gt;
wrenched the whole out of its position, and&lt;br /&gt;
in an instant he found himself in the arms&lt;br /&gt;
of his brother. When the first emotions&lt;br /&gt;
attendant on such an occasion had subsided,&lt;br /&gt;
they resolved to return by the way Gerald&lt;br /&gt;
had entered the dungeon. Louis there-&lt;br /&gt;
fore searching the pockets of the deceased&lt;br /&gt;
murderer, found the keys which fastened&lt;br /&gt;
the chains round the body of Henry, and&lt;br /&gt;
liberated him. Leaving the lamp upon&lt;br /&gt;
the table, they quitted this gloomy dungeon,&lt;br /&gt;
intending to direct their steps towards the&lt;br /&gt;
mansions of the living without any light,&lt;br /&gt;
rather than expose themselves to detection.&lt;br /&gt;
Carefully moving along the vaults, they&lt;br /&gt;
passed the trap door, through which Louis&lt;br /&gt;
had descended, and ascended the staircase;&lt;br /&gt;
as they were moving along the dark passa-&lt;br /&gt;
ges at the top, they heard the report of a&lt;br /&gt;
pistol at some distance, and in a few min-&lt;br /&gt;
utes they were joined by M. Dupont, who&lt;br /&gt;
placing his finger on his lips in token of si-&lt;br /&gt;
lence, beckoned them to follow him, and&lt;br /&gt;
proceeded with hasty steps in the di-&lt;br /&gt;
rection towards the door by which they&lt;br /&gt;
had entered the castle: but as they were&lt;br /&gt;
descending the spiral staircase, they heard&lt;br /&gt;
a hoarse voice at the bottom, calling to o-&lt;br /&gt;
thers, and bidding them “ guard all the&lt;br /&gt;
out-lets, and they had them safe enough.”&lt;br /&gt;
They, upon hearing this, measured back&lt;br /&gt;
their steps with rapidity, and were as quick-&lt;br /&gt;
ly pursued by others, whose hoarse voices&lt;br /&gt;
proceeding in different directions, announ-&lt;br /&gt;
ced their approach. The fugitives were&lt;br /&gt;
obliged to separate, and Louis and Henry&lt;br /&gt;
entered a recess, which by its gloom fa-&lt;br /&gt;
voured their concealment. Unfortunately,&lt;br /&gt;
their pursuers thought proper to search it,&lt;br /&gt;
and they were both discovered, conducted&lt;br /&gt;
to separate apartments, and put in fetters,&lt;br /&gt;
to prevent the possibility of their escape.&lt;br /&gt;
Henry, reduced in mind and body by the&lt;br /&gt;
Severity of his confinement, suffered himself&lt;br /&gt;
to be bound without murmuring, but the&lt;br /&gt;
ardent spirit of his brother Louis, disdain-&lt;br /&gt;
ed confinement, and it was with difficulty&lt;br /&gt;
They secured him. He demanded for&lt;br /&gt;
what reason he was to be kept a pri-&lt;br /&gt;
soner, and heaped curses upon them,&lt;br /&gt;
but they only sneered at his impatience,&lt;br /&gt;
and left him to his own thoughts. Mean-&lt;br /&gt;
while M. Dupont, and those who ac-&lt;br /&gt;
companied him, had found their way to&lt;br /&gt;
the subterranean apartments, and by means&lt;br /&gt;
of a breach made by the all-destroying&lt;br /&gt;
hand of time, escaped from the walls of the&lt;br /&gt;
castle. His first step was to go to court,&lt;br /&gt;
where he stated to the king every circum-&lt;br /&gt;
stance, and was allowed a body of soldiers&lt;br /&gt;
to search the castle. They did so, but in&lt;br /&gt;
vain, not a soul was to be found, all was un-&lt;br /&gt;
disturbed solitude, and he was under the&lt;br /&gt;
necessity of leaving his wards to their fate.&lt;br /&gt;
Months passed away, but the cloud of my-&lt;br /&gt;
stery was not dispelled, when one evening,&lt;br /&gt;
when the family had all retired to bed, a&lt;br /&gt;
violent knocking was heard at gate.&lt;br /&gt;
This untimely intrusion roused M. Dupont,&lt;br /&gt;
who dressed himself, and went below to&lt;br /&gt;
know the cause; he found the servants&lt;br /&gt;
huddled together, disputing who should&lt;br /&gt;
open the gate, for since the inexplicable&lt;br /&gt;
disappearance of Louis and Henry, a su-&lt;br /&gt;
perstitious fear had pervaded the bosom of&lt;br /&gt;
every domestic. M. Dupont ordered them&lt;br /&gt;
to follow him, and he opened the gate,&lt;br /&gt;
when in rushed a figure covered with blood&lt;br /&gt;
and dust–a sanguine stream issuing from&lt;br /&gt;
his arm, which hung lifeless at his side.&lt;br /&gt;
The servants uttered a cry of terror, and&lt;br /&gt;
clung round their master, when the stran-&lt;br /&gt;
ger sunk on the floor, fainting through&lt;br /&gt;
loss of blood. A couch was prepared for&lt;br /&gt;
him, and every attempt made to recall&lt;br /&gt;
departed animation, but in vain: the face&lt;br /&gt;
was cleansed of the blood which besmeared&lt;br /&gt;
it, and the pallid features proclaimed that&lt;br /&gt;
the stranger was the lost Louis. Grieved&lt;br /&gt;
to the soul to be obliged to lose him the&lt;br /&gt;
moment he was found, M. Dupont exert-&lt;br /&gt;
ed himself to blow into existence the latent&lt;br /&gt;
spark of life, and was at length successful.&lt;br /&gt;
The blood flowing from the wound in his&lt;br /&gt;
arm was staunched, and a deep groan is-&lt;br /&gt;
sued from his lips. The faint prospect of&lt;br /&gt;
recovering him, stimulated the faithful&lt;br /&gt;
guardian to new exertion, and he had at&lt;br /&gt;
length the satisfaction of perceiving his&lt;br /&gt;
eyes open, and a reviving cordial complete-&lt;br /&gt;
ly restored him to life: But a delirious&lt;br /&gt;
fever raged through his veins, and he ra-&lt;br /&gt;
ved with all the incoherence of madness:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;“his brother, his murdered brother,”&lt;/em&gt; was&lt;br /&gt;
the principal object on which his wander-&lt;br /&gt;
ing fancy seemed to rest. Seven days he&lt;br /&gt;
existed under the influence of madness,&lt;br /&gt;
when his ravings subsided, and he sunk&lt;br /&gt;
into a state of insensibility. M. Dupont&lt;br /&gt;
was sensible that the crises of his disorder&lt;br /&gt;
was at hand, and conceived his inanimate&lt;br /&gt;
situation as only a prelude to dissolution.&lt;br /&gt;
“Ill fated youth, he exclaimed,” evil was&lt;br /&gt;
the planet that presided at thy birth, under&lt;br /&gt;
its influence have all thy days been tainted&lt;br /&gt;
with misfortune, and the dart of death is al-&lt;br /&gt;
ready extended to deprive thee of existence.&lt;br /&gt;
Small has been thy portion of happiness&lt;br /&gt;
here, but thy reward is yet to come.”&lt;br /&gt;
The worthy owner of the chateau had&lt;br /&gt;
sent for a surgeon from the neighbouring&lt;br /&gt;
village as soon as he had discovered in&lt;br /&gt;
the person of the wounded stranger his belov-&lt;br /&gt;
ed Louis. M. Burton, the surgeon who&lt;br /&gt;
was expected, was an English gentleman&lt;br /&gt;
who had studied physic and surgery under&lt;br /&gt;
the most eminent of the profession in Lon-&lt;br /&gt;
don, but owing to some disgust he had tak-&lt;br /&gt;
en to his native country, he retired to&lt;br /&gt;
France, and took up his residence at the&lt;br /&gt;
village in the vicinity of the chateau, where&lt;br /&gt;
he continued the practice of his profession,&lt;br /&gt;
with equal ability and success. He posses-&lt;br /&gt;
sed a perfect knowledge of the French lan-&lt;br /&gt;
guage, as he had resided in the kingdom&lt;br /&gt;
for many years, and could converse on any&lt;br /&gt;
subject with ease: his sentiments were ex-&lt;br /&gt;
pressed without affectation, and his con-&lt;br /&gt;
versation displayed superior talents and&lt;br /&gt;
refinement: it may therefore be supposed,&lt;br /&gt;
that he was a frequent visitant at the cha-&lt;br /&gt;
teau, where his arrival was ever greeted&lt;br /&gt;
with all unaffected welcome. He had&lt;br /&gt;
married a French lady, by whom he had&lt;br /&gt;
one daughter, and this endearing tie bound&lt;br /&gt;
him still closer to the country. Upon&lt;br /&gt;
Monsieur Burton’s examining Louis’s arm,&lt;br /&gt;
while he was insensible, he found that a&lt;br /&gt;
ball had been lodged there, but it was&lt;br /&gt;
luckily extracted without injury. At M.&lt;br /&gt;
Dupont’s request, this humane gentleman,&lt;br /&gt;
whose heart was ever alive to sensibility,&lt;br /&gt;
consented to remain a the chateau, till rea-&lt;br /&gt;
son superceded madness, or his patient&lt;br /&gt;
paid “the great debt of nature.” The&lt;br /&gt;
crisis of his disorder was fast approaching,&lt;br /&gt;
his breath grew short, and delusive hope&lt;br /&gt;
was banished from every bosom, and gave&lt;br /&gt;
place to despondency. Every countenance&lt;br /&gt;
wore the livery of sorrow, and gave the&lt;br /&gt;
strongest testimony of the love they bore&lt;br /&gt;
to him; at length he appeared to have en-&lt;br /&gt;
tirely ceased to suspire; all his melancho-&lt;br /&gt;
ly friends were seated round the bed,&lt;br /&gt;
waiting the moment when his soul should&lt;br /&gt;
depart “to him who gave it.” The silence&lt;br /&gt;
which had reigned for some time, was at&lt;br /&gt;
length interrupted by M. Burton’s saying&lt;br /&gt;
in a low tone, “I believe all is now over,&lt;br /&gt;
but there is a possibility that he yet lives,&lt;br /&gt;
and may be only sleeping.” Then turning&lt;br /&gt;
to one of the servants, he ordered him to&lt;br /&gt;
bring him a small mirror, which he placed&lt;br /&gt;
before his lips for a few minutes, and upon&lt;br /&gt;
examining it found it sullied, and commu-&lt;br /&gt;
nicated the pleasing intelligence to his&lt;br /&gt;
mournful auditors, that he yet breathed,&lt;br /&gt;
and was asleep, which he considered as a&lt;br /&gt;
happy omen. Several hours did the unfor-&lt;br /&gt;
tunate Louis remain perfectly insensible,&lt;br /&gt;
but at length he moved, to the revival of&lt;br /&gt;
the hopes of his friends, and in a few mi-&lt;br /&gt;
nutes opened his eyes, and stretching out&lt;br /&gt;
his hand to M. Dupont gently pressed his,&lt;br /&gt;
while a faint smile gleamed across his&lt;br /&gt;
countenance, on which they thought the&lt;br /&gt;
unremovable seal of death had been af-&lt;br /&gt;
fixed. From this time his health gradually&lt;br /&gt;
returned, and in a few weeks he was able&lt;br /&gt;
to leave his room, but not a word was ut-&lt;br /&gt;
tered by him respecting the affairs of the&lt;br /&gt;
castle, and whenever it was alluded to, it&lt;br /&gt;
seemed to turn his brain to madness. As&lt;br /&gt;
it seemed to affect him in such an extra-&lt;br /&gt;
ordinary manner, M. Dupont deferred an&lt;br /&gt;
explanation of past events, till he was per-&lt;br /&gt;
fectly restored, and time had in some mea-&lt;br /&gt;
sure obliterated the traces of this unknown&lt;br /&gt;
misfortune from his memory, or at least de-&lt;br /&gt;
stroyed the keenness of the injuries he had&lt;br /&gt;
received. JULIUS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[4. 23 May 1801]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Continued.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEANWHILE the Count de Vauban,&lt;br /&gt;
whose unbounded extravagance reduced&lt;br /&gt;
him to the verge of ruin, was obliged to&lt;br /&gt;
abscond from the importunity of his cre-&lt;br /&gt;
ditors; but when Louis and Henry were&lt;br /&gt;
both lost, he thought proper to come for-&lt;br /&gt;
ward and claim their fortunes: at the ear-&lt;br /&gt;
nest prayer of M. Dupont the grant of&lt;br /&gt;
them to the Count was deferred by the king&lt;br /&gt;
for one year, promising, that if in that time,&lt;br /&gt;
one of them did not appear, he should be&lt;br /&gt;
put in possession of them. As M. Dupont&lt;br /&gt;
still entertained suspicions of the Count, he&lt;br /&gt;
did not think it necessary to inform the King,&lt;br /&gt;
that the lawful owner of the estates was&lt;br /&gt;
found, till Louis was able to carry himself&lt;br /&gt;
the evidence of it. Therefore as soon as&lt;br /&gt;
he was well enough to travel, he set out,&lt;br /&gt;
attended by two servants, well armed for&lt;br /&gt;
the security of their master, and proceeded&lt;br /&gt;
by easy stages to Paris, to claim the inves-&lt;br /&gt;
titure of the states, as his age authorised the&lt;br /&gt;
demand. Louis the fifteenth, who then ruled&lt;br /&gt;
over that fertile and extensive kingdom,&lt;br /&gt;
without hesitation ordered him to be put&lt;br /&gt;
in possession of all the fortune his father&lt;br /&gt;
had left, which was far from being small,&lt;br /&gt;
though principally vested in the funds: his&lt;br /&gt;
landed estate only consisted of the chateau&lt;br /&gt;
and grounds occupied by M. Dupont.&lt;br /&gt;
Upon his return, night overtook him two&lt;br /&gt;
leagues from the chateau, but his desire of&lt;br /&gt;
reaching it determined him to proceed,&lt;br /&gt;
notwithstanding the darkness, and a wood&lt;br /&gt;
which he was obliged to pass through, in&lt;br /&gt;
which several robberies and murders had&lt;br /&gt;
been perpetrated. He had passed through&lt;br /&gt;
the greater part of it without any alarm,&lt;br /&gt;
when just as he approached the farther&lt;br /&gt;
side, a report of a pistol, followed by the&lt;br /&gt;
clashing of swords, roused him from a re-&lt;br /&gt;
verie into which he had fallen. Clapping&lt;br /&gt;
spurs to his horse, he hastened forward with&lt;br /&gt;
the servants at full speed; the moon at in-&lt;br /&gt;
tervals shone forth from the broken clouds,&lt;br /&gt;
and very opportunely yielded her light for&lt;br /&gt;
him to perceive a group of men, apparent-&lt;br /&gt;
ly of different parties, as the clashing of&lt;br /&gt;
swords announced an encounter. Impelled&lt;br /&gt;
by the natural generosity of his disposition,&lt;br /&gt;
he hastened to join the weaker party, who&lt;br /&gt;
thus reinforced soon put their adversaries&lt;br /&gt;
to flight. A gentleman who seemed to be&lt;br /&gt;
the superior of the party, was slightly&lt;br /&gt;
wounded, and thro’ fear of its being irri-&lt;br /&gt;
tated by riding far, he accepted an invita-&lt;br /&gt;
tion to the chateau, which he had accorded&lt;br /&gt;
in the politest terms. They found M. Dupont&lt;br /&gt;
and his family expecting Louis with anxie-&lt;br /&gt;
ty, and his guests they treated with the&lt;br /&gt;
most hospitable politeness. Before they&lt;br /&gt;
retired, Louis begged to know what had&lt;br /&gt;
occasioned the rencounter in the forest, and&lt;br /&gt;
whom it was he had the good fortune to&lt;br /&gt;
assist upon that occasion. The stranger&lt;br /&gt;
informed him, that he was no other than&lt;br /&gt;
the Duke of Alencon, who upon his way&lt;br /&gt;
to his seat a short distance beyond the cha-&lt;br /&gt;
teau, had the misfortune of breaking his&lt;br /&gt;
carriage, and as he did not wish to stay&lt;br /&gt;
till it was repaired, he proceeded on horse-&lt;br /&gt;
back with a few servants, and in the forest&lt;br /&gt;
had been attacked by some men, whom he&lt;br /&gt;
supposed to be banditti. He overwhelm-&lt;br /&gt;
ed Louis with his thanks, and the next&lt;br /&gt;
morning insisted upon his accompanying&lt;br /&gt;
him to his castle, to which he consented, as&lt;br /&gt;
the easy behaviour of the Duke had entire-&lt;br /&gt;
ly won his confidence. He remained with&lt;br /&gt;
him several weeks, and every day raised&lt;br /&gt;
them in each other’s estimation, till Louis&lt;br /&gt;
had resolved to open his whole soul to him.&lt;br /&gt;
This he deferred till his venerable guardian&lt;br /&gt;
should come to the castle, whither he had&lt;br /&gt;
been urged to present himself. The Duke&lt;br /&gt;
of Alencon had one son and one daughter,&lt;br /&gt;
to whom all his immense estates would be-&lt;br /&gt;
long; the daughter possessed all the graces&lt;br /&gt;
of the sex, but her brother the Marquis de&lt;br /&gt;
Lantz, disgraced his distinguished rank by&lt;br /&gt;
his vicious propensities. Antoniette de&lt;br /&gt;
Lantz (this was the Duke’s family name)&lt;br /&gt;
had been universally admired, and Louis&lt;br /&gt;
understood that a young nobleman, who&lt;br /&gt;
was one of her suitors, was favoured by&lt;br /&gt;
the Marquis, and approved by Alencon.&lt;br /&gt;
Notwithstanding the caution which this&lt;br /&gt;
information was calculated to give, young&lt;br /&gt;
Boileau could not exclude the passion of&lt;br /&gt;
love from his bosom, and the image of An-&lt;br /&gt;
toniette haunted him continually. At length&lt;br /&gt;
he was told that the lover of Mademoiselle&lt;br /&gt;
de Lantz, was expected at the castle the&lt;br /&gt;
day following, and the day after M. Dupont&lt;br /&gt;
had announced his intention of visiting the&lt;br /&gt;
Duke. Curiosity to see the man to whom&lt;br /&gt;
his admired Antoniette would probably be&lt;br /&gt;
joined in the bands of marriage, prevented&lt;br /&gt;
him from sleeping, and he arose early the&lt;br /&gt;
next morning, with his ideas occupied by&lt;br /&gt;
the same subject. After he had breakfast-&lt;br /&gt;
ed, he remained in the parlour with the&lt;br /&gt;
Duke, Antoniette and the Marquis, when&lt;br /&gt;
a carriage drove into the yard. “It is the&lt;br /&gt;
Count,” exclaims the Marquis, and flew out&lt;br /&gt;
of the room to receive him, while Louis&lt;br /&gt;
walked to one of the windows and saw a&lt;br /&gt;
light from his carriage the &lt;em&gt;Count de Vauban&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Astonishment transfixed him to the spot,&lt;br /&gt;
and contradictory ideas passed through his&lt;br /&gt;
brain with such rapidity, as almost to de-&lt;br /&gt;
range him. To find his uncle, whom he&lt;br /&gt;
strongly suspected of being the source of all&lt;br /&gt;
his misfortunes, received into the family of&lt;br /&gt;
the Duke of Alencon, as the approved lo-&lt;br /&gt;
ver of his daughter, almost surpassed com-&lt;br /&gt;
prehension. He however, fortunately re-&lt;br /&gt;
covered his presence of mind, before the&lt;br /&gt;
Count entered the room, and determined&lt;br /&gt;
to observe his countenance with the most&lt;br /&gt;
watchful scrutiny. De Vauban entered,&lt;br /&gt;
introduced by the Marquis with smiles in&lt;br /&gt;
his aspect, when his attention was arrested&lt;br /&gt;
by the sight of his nephew, his counte-&lt;br /&gt;
nance displayed contending emotions, and&lt;br /&gt;
guilt and fear were delineated in every&lt;br /&gt;
feature. The company observed the ex-&lt;br /&gt;
traordinary confusion of the Count, and&lt;br /&gt;
were at a loss to account for it, or the pier-&lt;br /&gt;
cing attention with which Louis regarded&lt;br /&gt;
him: but in a short time de Vauban’s wont-&lt;br /&gt;
ed ease of manners returned, and he paid his&lt;br /&gt;
compliments to the company, apologizing&lt;br /&gt;
for his emotion, which he said was to be at-&lt;br /&gt;
tributed to his surprise, at again seeing his&lt;br /&gt;
runaway nephew, who he had much feared&lt;br /&gt;
had been lost to his friends for ever. He&lt;br /&gt;
then acquainted the company with their&lt;br /&gt;
consanguinity, but was completely at a loss&lt;br /&gt;
to enter into conversation with Louis, who&lt;br /&gt;
sat totally silent wrapt in his own reflections.&lt;br /&gt;
To all their enquiries respecting his absence,&lt;br /&gt;
of which the Count had spoken, he gave&lt;br /&gt;
incoherent replies, and instantly relapsed&lt;br /&gt;
into his abstraction of mind to what was&lt;br /&gt;
passing before him. The day passed with a&lt;br /&gt;
degree of unsociability, to which the fam-&lt;br /&gt;
ily of the Duke of Alencon were unaccus-&lt;br /&gt;
tomed, but the unusual reserve, to them so&lt;br /&gt;
mysterious, which clouded the manners of&lt;br /&gt;
their two guests, deprived them of their&lt;br /&gt;
wonted cheerfulness. The Duke, to whom&lt;br /&gt;
Louis had endeared himself in the first place,&lt;br /&gt;
by according him his assistance when be-&lt;br /&gt;
set in the forest, with so much celerity, and&lt;br /&gt;
which his affectionate manners had confirm-&lt;br /&gt;
ed, was anxious to know what occasioned the&lt;br /&gt;
uneasiness under which his young friend&lt;br /&gt;
seemed to labour, and they all separated to&lt;br /&gt;
retire to bed at night, seemingly pleased&lt;br /&gt;
that the day was expired. Louis was un-&lt;br /&gt;
able to sleep, from the concurrence of cir-&lt;br /&gt;
cumstances which a short time had produ-&lt;br /&gt;
ced; the confusion of the Count upon their&lt;br /&gt;
interview, almost confirmed his suspicions&lt;br /&gt;
that he was the cause of his imprisonment.&lt;br /&gt;
Restless and tormented with his own ideas,&lt;br /&gt;
he arose, dressed and seated himself at the&lt;br /&gt;
window;–opening the casement to give&lt;br /&gt;
admission to the air, he observed a man&lt;br /&gt;
walking on the terrace below, apparently&lt;br /&gt;
waiting for some one, and in a few minutes&lt;br /&gt;
he was joined by another. The casement&lt;br /&gt;
at which he sat, was too high from the ter-&lt;br /&gt;
race to permit him to hear the whole of&lt;br /&gt;
the discourse that ensued, but he found&lt;br /&gt;
that it was an assignation. Curiosity to&lt;br /&gt;
know who it was that had taken this oppor-&lt;br /&gt;
tunity for a private interview, prompted&lt;br /&gt;
him to listen, and he found it was the Mar-&lt;br /&gt;
quis and the Count de Vauban. He was&lt;br /&gt;
so much interested in every thing which&lt;br /&gt;
concerned his uncle, that he could not re-&lt;br /&gt;
frain from listening, and from what part of&lt;br /&gt;
their discourse reached his ear, he found it&lt;br /&gt;
of dreadful import. He had conceived a&lt;br /&gt;
dislike to the Marquis at first sight, which&lt;br /&gt;
had been strengthened by his manners to-&lt;br /&gt;
wards him, but he now found him to be&lt;br /&gt;
a man, in whom every species of villainy&lt;br /&gt;
were concentrated. The attack made up-&lt;br /&gt;
on the Duke of Alencon in the forest,&lt;br /&gt;
where Louis had been the means of his res-&lt;br /&gt;
cue, had been the act of the Count’s des-&lt;br /&gt;
perate dependants under his influence. De&lt;br /&gt;
Vauban’s situation with respect to pecuni-&lt;br /&gt;
ary affairs, was desperate, and in order to rid&lt;br /&gt;
himself of the importunity of his creditors,&lt;br /&gt;
he had afforded protection to a party of&lt;br /&gt;
banditti, who resided in the environs of&lt;br /&gt;
the Castle, which had been the scene of the&lt;br /&gt;
Boileaus’ imprisonment. From this place&lt;br /&gt;
They made depredations throughout the vi-&lt;br /&gt;
cinity, and a considerable dividend of their&lt;br /&gt;
plunder was appropriated to the use of de&lt;br /&gt;
Vauban. But as this was a very uncer-&lt;br /&gt;
tain dependence, the Count had listened&lt;br /&gt;
to proposals from the Marquis de Lantz,&lt;br /&gt;
who also felt his extravagance limited by&lt;br /&gt;
the prudence of the Duke, to assassinate his&lt;br /&gt;
father, and share with him the large estates&lt;br /&gt;
which would then come into his possession.&lt;br /&gt;
This horrid scheme, of which Louis had&lt;br /&gt;
been the means of disappointing, plainly&lt;br /&gt;
proves that de Vauban Would hesitate at&lt;br /&gt;
nothing, that had a tendency to promote&lt;br /&gt;
his views. The conversation then turned&lt;br /&gt;
upon Louis, and the Count de Vauban re-&lt;br /&gt;
lated to the Marquis the obstacle he was&lt;br /&gt;
to the possession of M. Boileau’s estate,&lt;br /&gt;
and communicated his desire of having him&lt;br /&gt;
removed, to his worthless companion, who&lt;br /&gt;
readily assented to his intentions, and they&lt;br /&gt;
removed to another part of the terrace to&lt;br /&gt;
lay the plan of their future proceedings.&lt;br /&gt;
The horror which pervaded the breast of&lt;br /&gt;
Louis was indescribable; to find that any&lt;br /&gt;
Human being should be so lost to every&lt;br /&gt;
sense of rectitude, as to not only connive&lt;br /&gt;
at, but to assist in an attempt, to murder his&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;own father&lt;/em&gt;, was more than he could ever have&lt;br /&gt;
supposed. Nothing more transpired of their&lt;br /&gt;
intentions that night, and the day dawned&lt;br /&gt;
upon Louis, while he remained fixed at the&lt;br /&gt;
casement so deeply wrapt in meditation,&lt;br /&gt;
and he was scarcely conscious of his exis-&lt;br /&gt;
tence. When roused from his reveries,&lt;br /&gt;
he was almost ready to conclude that it was&lt;br /&gt;
a horrid dream; but memory recalled to&lt;br /&gt;
his imagination the conversation he had&lt;br /&gt;
heard, too forcibly to suffer him to admit&lt;br /&gt;
the pleasing supposition. The next day&lt;br /&gt;
brought M. Dupont to the Castle de Alen-&lt;br /&gt;
con, and as soon as possible a private in-&lt;br /&gt;
terview was obtained·with Louis and the&lt;br /&gt;
Duke, when, after receiving the request of&lt;br /&gt;
his two friends, Louis racapitulated his ad-&lt;br /&gt;
ventures in the castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[5. 30 May 1801]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Continued.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HE commenced his relation, when him-&lt;br /&gt;
self and Henry were separated from M.&lt;br /&gt;
Dupont, and entered the recess. He re-&lt;br /&gt;
counted the insults he received upon his&lt;br /&gt;
being found, and, together with his bro-&lt;br /&gt;
ther, being closely confined in irons. His daily&lt;br /&gt;
pittance was brought him by a ruffian, whose&lt;br /&gt;
countenance indicated villainy of the deep-&lt;br /&gt;
est dye; to all his requests to know by&lt;br /&gt;
whose authority, and for what reason he&lt;br /&gt;
was kept a prisoner, no answer was return-&lt;br /&gt;
ed, nor could all his entreaties procure him&lt;br /&gt;
information of the fate of Henry. All was&lt;br /&gt;
incertitude, and his imagination conjured&lt;br /&gt;
up the form of Henry, receiving his death-&lt;br /&gt;
wound from the hand of an assassin, who&lt;br /&gt;
would next plunge the weapon, perhaps&lt;br /&gt;
yet reeking in his brother’s gore, into his&lt;br /&gt;
own bosom. A few days only had elapsed,&lt;br /&gt;
when his keeper entered the prison, ac-&lt;br /&gt;
companied by two others, and he was led&lt;br /&gt;
out, (the two men following him with&lt;br /&gt;
drawn swords,) and conveyed through the&lt;br /&gt;
subterranean apartments, to a remote place,&lt;br /&gt;
where he naturally concluded his life was&lt;br /&gt;
to be terminated. But he was mistaken, for&lt;br /&gt;
he had soon the pleasure of seeing Henry&lt;br /&gt;
conducted into the same apartment, which&lt;br /&gt;
was filled with armed men, and found that&lt;br /&gt;
their removal was on account of a body of&lt;br /&gt;
troops under M. Dupont, approaching to&lt;br /&gt;
search the castle. They distinctly heard&lt;br /&gt;
them at a distance in the building, and the&lt;br /&gt;
hopes of the prisoners began to revive; but&lt;br /&gt;
after a few hours had elapsed, they had the&lt;br /&gt;
mortification of hearing them depart, and&lt;br /&gt;
all the fond visions of liberty, which fancy&lt;br /&gt;
had created, vanished, and gloomy despair&lt;br /&gt;
usurped their place.– No embrace was&lt;br /&gt;
permitted them, nor were they allowed&lt;br /&gt;
to speak to each other, and they were con-&lt;br /&gt;
ducted back to their cells without enjoying&lt;br /&gt;
any satisfaction from the interview, but&lt;br /&gt;
what Louis derived from seeing the youth&lt;br /&gt;
of his brother, bearing up against the ill ef-&lt;br /&gt;
fects of confinement, and his recovering his&lt;br /&gt;
health notwithstanding all his misfortunes.&lt;br /&gt;
But his own countenance could convey no&lt;br /&gt;
such satisfaction to his brother, for it bore&lt;br /&gt;
the stamp of melancholy, and when a smile&lt;br /&gt;
illuminated his pallid features upon the ap-&lt;br /&gt;
pearance of Henry, like the gleam of a&lt;br /&gt;
meteor in a watery atmosphere, it quickly&lt;br /&gt;
disappeared. The same dull routine occu-&lt;br /&gt;
pied the time of his imprisonment, without&lt;br /&gt;
any material occurrence, when one even-&lt;br /&gt;
ing after the guard had seen him for the&lt;br /&gt;
last time that night, as he was pacing with&lt;br /&gt;
“heavy steps and slow” the floor of his&lt;br /&gt;
prison, a dismal long-drawn groan, reach-&lt;br /&gt;
ed his ear. His chains had been taken off&lt;br /&gt;
some time, as his keepers supposed the door&lt;br /&gt;
secured with massy bars and bolts, suffice-&lt;br /&gt;
ent. The idea that this horrid sound might&lt;br /&gt;
be the last groan of his brother, roused into&lt;br /&gt;
exertion all his dormant faculties, which had&lt;br /&gt;
sunk through inactivity into nerveless indo-&lt;br /&gt;
lence. He examined the door, and to his&lt;br /&gt;
inexpressible surprise he found it had been&lt;br /&gt;
left unfastened through the negligence of&lt;br /&gt;
his keeper; taking advantage of this lucky&lt;br /&gt;
occurrence, he issued from his prison, and&lt;br /&gt;
passed hastily along the passage; a door&lt;br /&gt;
half open arrested his progress, and an ir-&lt;br /&gt;
resistable impulse urged him to inspect the&lt;br /&gt;
room. A lamp suspended from the ceiling,&lt;br /&gt;
in the same manner as in the cell where he&lt;br /&gt;
had been confined, afforded its glimmering&lt;br /&gt;
light, and presented to his view a scene&lt;br /&gt;
replete with horror. It was the body of&lt;br /&gt;
his brother Henry, laying in his gore, who&lt;br /&gt;
thus in the spring of life, ere he had tasted&lt;br /&gt;
its pleasures, had bidden them adieu for&lt;br /&gt;
ever. Driven to distraction by the horrific&lt;br /&gt;
appearance, he rushed out of the room, and&lt;br /&gt;
flew along the passage with such rapidity,&lt;br /&gt;
that he would have been mistaken for an&lt;br /&gt;
aerial being, the sound of whose footsteps&lt;br /&gt;
were not perceptible to mortal ear. Not&lt;br /&gt;
knowing whither it led, he pursued the&lt;br /&gt;
avenue till it terminated in a postern gate,&lt;br /&gt;
which was open, and where two centinels&lt;br /&gt;
were stationed. With the velocity of light-&lt;br /&gt;
ning he flew past them, and, unconscious&lt;br /&gt;
of the action, quitted the hated walls which&lt;br /&gt;
had been productive of so much misery to&lt;br /&gt;
himself and his loved Henry, leaving the&lt;br /&gt;
centinels stupefied with surprise and terror.&lt;br /&gt;
But ere Louis could proceed far from the&lt;br /&gt;
castle they recalled their scattered faculties,&lt;br /&gt;
and discharged their muskets in the direc-&lt;br /&gt;
tion he had taken, and with two much suc-&lt;br /&gt;
cess, for the contents of one of them was&lt;br /&gt;
lodged in his arm, and felled him to the&lt;br /&gt;
earth. Animated with almost supernatural&lt;br /&gt;
strength, he arose and resumed his progress&lt;br /&gt;
towards the chateau, which he just reached&lt;br /&gt;
when all his strength failed him, and he&lt;br /&gt;
sunk into a state of total insensibility, as has&lt;br /&gt;
been mentioned before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Louis had finished his relation, a&lt;br /&gt;
consultation was held upon the most proba-&lt;br /&gt;
ble means to evade any future attacks&lt;br /&gt;
which might be made on his person. To&lt;br /&gt;
relate the conversation young Boileau had&lt;br /&gt;
overheard the preceding night, would&lt;br /&gt;
give the Duke of Alencon too severe a&lt;br /&gt;
shock, he therefore deferred speaking of it&lt;br /&gt;
till he could have a private interview with&lt;br /&gt;
M. Dupont, and as the suspicions of the whole&lt;br /&gt;
party attached to the Count, it was resolved&lt;br /&gt;
that they should return the same day to the&lt;br /&gt;
chateau; the Duke intended to take the first&lt;br /&gt;
opportunity to dismiss the Count, and de-&lt;br /&gt;
stroy all his hopes of an alliance with his&lt;br /&gt;
daughter. Agreeable to the plan they had&lt;br /&gt;
adopted, M. Dupont and Louis returned&lt;br /&gt;
to the chateau; and the same afternoon the&lt;br /&gt;
Count de Vauban, in a private conference&lt;br /&gt;
With the Duke of Alencon, avowed his at-&lt;br /&gt;
tachment to Mademoiselle de Lantz, and&lt;br /&gt;
demanded her hand in marriage. The pro-&lt;br /&gt;
posal was rejected in the most civil terms,&lt;br /&gt;
to the great surprize, and mortification of&lt;br /&gt;
de Vauban, who, after a secret inter-&lt;br /&gt;
view with the Marquis, departed from the&lt;br /&gt;
castle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Arrived at such an advanced period of&lt;br /&gt;
our history, let us take a review of the life&lt;br /&gt;
of de Vauban, as far as concerns his ne-&lt;br /&gt;
phews. Possessing a perfect knowledge&lt;br /&gt;
of his brother’s wealth, he no sooner receiv-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the intelligence of his death, than he&lt;br /&gt;
conceived the: nefarious design on remov-&lt;br /&gt;
ing his nephews by force, and enjoying&lt;br /&gt;
the uninterrupted possession of the estate.&lt;br /&gt;
The execution of his purpose would how-&lt;br /&gt;
ever be attended with difficulty, but he&lt;br /&gt;
was not to be discouraged, and he concert-&lt;br /&gt;
ed his plan with precision, determined by&lt;br /&gt;
perseverance to surmount every obstacle.&lt;br /&gt;
His dependents were numerous, and he&lt;br /&gt;
well knew would execute any thing he&lt;br /&gt;
could wish. For the purpose of securing&lt;br /&gt;
his nephews, he stationed a number of the&lt;br /&gt;
villains under his protection in the castle,&lt;br /&gt;
some parts of which, were in a ruinous si-&lt;br /&gt;
tuation, and when M. Dupont retired&lt;br /&gt;
with his wards to his country seat, de&lt;br /&gt;
Vauban, who frequently visited them, dili-&lt;br /&gt;
gently explored every part of the building,&lt;br /&gt;
and found the ruined wing communicated&lt;br /&gt;
by narrow passages with that in which the&lt;br /&gt;
family resided. Ever on the watch for an&lt;br /&gt;
opportunity to reduce his plans to practice,&lt;br /&gt;
he discovered in the apartment assigned&lt;br /&gt;
to Henry, a private door, which was en-&lt;br /&gt;
tirely unknown to any of the family. Thro’&lt;br /&gt;
this he gave admission in the night to some&lt;br /&gt;
of his ruffian attendants, who conveyed&lt;br /&gt;
Henry to the castle, where he was con-&lt;br /&gt;
Fined in a damp prison, and fettered. No&lt;br /&gt;
Ray of light illuminated the obscurity of&lt;br /&gt;
The dungeon, nor served to cheer his me-&lt;br /&gt;
lancholy situation, save what one glimmer-&lt;br /&gt;
ing taper afforded. A superstitious fear&lt;br /&gt;
prevented de Vauban’s immediately order-&lt;br /&gt;
ing the assassination of Henry, but he left&lt;br /&gt;
him a pray to torturing sensations, and the&lt;br /&gt;
pestiferous atmosphere of his prison. But&lt;br /&gt;
when he learned the arrival of M. Dupont’s&lt;br /&gt;
family in the neighbourhood, the fear of&lt;br /&gt;
being discovered induced him to order&lt;br /&gt;
Henry’s death, and insure his own safety:&lt;br /&gt;
but this unfortunate termination of his life,&lt;br /&gt;
was prevented by the timely interposition&lt;br /&gt;
of Louis, in the vaults of the castle, when&lt;br /&gt;
Gerald paid the forfeit of his crimes. Lou-&lt;br /&gt;
is for a considerable time eluded the vigi-&lt;br /&gt;
lance of his uncle, till the unfortunate ad-&lt;br /&gt;
venture of exploring the castle, when he&lt;br /&gt;
fell a victim to his temerity. The Count&lt;br /&gt;
carefully kept his abused nephews in un-&lt;br /&gt;
certainty respecting the author of their&lt;br /&gt;
misfortunes, lest any unavoidable accident,&lt;br /&gt;
which his guilty and mistrustful conscience&lt;br /&gt;
could not foresee or guard against, should&lt;br /&gt;
give them their liberty, and raise an in-&lt;br /&gt;
controvertible evidence of his guilt. Be-&lt;br /&gt;
ing disappointed in his expectations of im-&lt;br /&gt;
mediate possession of M. Boileau’s estate,&lt;br /&gt;
he obtained an introduction to the family&lt;br /&gt;
of Alencon, through the medium of the&lt;br /&gt;
Marquis, whom he had often met at the&lt;br /&gt;
gaming table: hoping to recruit his dis-&lt;br /&gt;
ordered and almost exhausted finances, by&lt;br /&gt;
a marriage with Antoniette. Fearful of his&lt;br /&gt;
anger, his dependents forbore to mention&lt;br /&gt;
to him the escape of Louis, and he had no&lt;br /&gt;
reason to suppose he had eluded his vil-&lt;br /&gt;
lainous intentions, till he met him at the&lt;br /&gt;
Duke of Alencon’s castle. The surprize&lt;br /&gt;
the sight of him occasioned, roused in his&lt;br /&gt;
bosom the dormant spark of shame, and&lt;br /&gt;
kindled the confusion which shone in his&lt;br /&gt;
countenance. When his nephew had de-&lt;br /&gt;
parted to the chateau, and he met with the&lt;br /&gt;
unexpected rejection of his proposals, on the&lt;br /&gt;
part of the duke, his enmity to Louis, who&lt;br /&gt;
he supposed had influenced the decision of&lt;br /&gt;
the Duke, was redoubled, and he vowed&lt;br /&gt;
the most sanguinary revenge. He depart-&lt;br /&gt;
ed sullen and mortified, for his castle, which&lt;br /&gt;
he had previously put in a state of defence,&lt;br /&gt;
as his capacious mind had prepared against&lt;br /&gt;
the evils of adversity, and admitted the pos-&lt;br /&gt;
sibility of his experiencing the frowns of for-&lt;br /&gt;
tune, and being obliged to recur to his&lt;br /&gt;
predatory system for support. Here, with&lt;br /&gt;
his band of ruffians, he resided, and spread&lt;br /&gt;
terror and devastation throughout the vi-&lt;br /&gt;
cinity. The Marquis being himself re-&lt;br /&gt;
stricted by his father, in his pecuniary af-&lt;br /&gt;
fairs, could afford him no assistance, and&lt;br /&gt;
tired with his frequent importunities, broke&lt;br /&gt;
the bonds of intimacy which had united&lt;br /&gt;
them. Had not the Marquis been of a&lt;br /&gt;
timid disposition, had he been endowed&lt;br /&gt;
with the daring courage of de Vauban, he&lt;br /&gt;
would have been a paricide, for he had a&lt;br /&gt;
heart sufficiently corrupted to harbour the&lt;br /&gt;
attrocious design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[6. 6 June 1801]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Continued.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE Count de Vauban had been long&lt;br /&gt;
invisible at the metropolis, being so much&lt;br /&gt;
engaged in his plans to get Louis again in&lt;br /&gt;
his hands. But as soon as the intelligence&lt;br /&gt;
reached M. Dupont, of de Vauban’s being&lt;br /&gt;
at the head of the banditti which infested&lt;br /&gt;
the vicinity, he prepared to remove to Paris,&lt;br /&gt;
sensible that when in possession of power,&lt;br /&gt;
he would regard no law, human or divine, to&lt;br /&gt;
effect his infamous purposes, and glut his&lt;br /&gt;
sanguinary revenge on Louis. Once alone&lt;br /&gt;
did de Vauban find an opportunity to make&lt;br /&gt;
an attempt upon the person of Louis,&lt;br /&gt;
which was before the commencement of&lt;br /&gt;
their journey to Paris, when one night he&lt;br /&gt;
made an assault upon the chateau, hoping&lt;br /&gt;
to be able to force his entrance. But the&lt;br /&gt;
family were roused at the first attack, and&lt;br /&gt;
seizing all the warlike weapons which they&lt;br /&gt;
could find in the house, they obliged them&lt;br /&gt;
to retire. It was a fortunate circumstance&lt;br /&gt;
that the owner of the chateau, upon the&lt;br /&gt;
first intelligence of the existence of a band&lt;br /&gt;
of robbers in the neighbourhood, had pro-&lt;br /&gt;
cured musquets and ammunition, in order&lt;br /&gt;
to be prepared against any event. This&lt;br /&gt;
occurrence hastened their departure, and&lt;br /&gt;
the next day they set out for the capital,&lt;br /&gt;
where they had prepared a residence.&lt;br /&gt;
Vice seldom fails ultimately to receive its&lt;br /&gt;
punishment, and the marquis de Lantz was&lt;br /&gt;
another instance of the reward of villainy,&lt;br /&gt;
whether executed or 1nercly concerted.&lt;br /&gt;
‘Tis true the imbecility of his mind and&lt;br /&gt;
his cowardice, prevented the execution of&lt;br /&gt;
his unnatural designs against the life of his&lt;br /&gt;
father, but it did not diminish his atrocity&lt;br /&gt;
in the conception of such an idea. He had&lt;br /&gt;
made an excursion to Dijon, where, among&lt;br /&gt;
his careless unthinking companions, he had&lt;br /&gt;
been passing away the tardy hours, and was&lt;br /&gt;
returning home for want of the necessary&lt;br /&gt;
money to support his extravagance. He had&lt;br /&gt;
not recovered from the influence of&lt;br /&gt;
wine, when he entered the forest, which&lt;br /&gt;
had been the theatre of murder perpetrated&lt;br /&gt;
by the lawless dependents of de Vauban.&lt;br /&gt;
He had sunk into a slumber, and the spell&lt;br /&gt;
which bound him in the embraces of Mor-&lt;br /&gt;
pheus, was so potent, that he heard not&lt;br /&gt;
the whistle of the banditti, nor knew of&lt;br /&gt;
their approach, till his attendants were fi-&lt;br /&gt;
red upon by them. All who could fly, made&lt;br /&gt;
their escape, as no tie attached them to the&lt;br /&gt;
fate of de Lantz, who scarcely was roused&lt;br /&gt;
from his stupidity, till the robbers roughly&lt;br /&gt;
ordered him to deliver up his money. This&lt;br /&gt;
demand he was unable to comply with, as&lt;br /&gt;
he had spent the last livre at the gaming-&lt;br /&gt;
table. Wine inspired him with something&lt;br /&gt;
like courage, of which his natural dispose-&lt;br /&gt;
tion was entirely destitute, and snatching&lt;br /&gt;
up his pistol that lay at his side, he dis-&lt;br /&gt;
charged it at the person next to him. This&lt;br /&gt;
was the signal of his fate, the murderers&lt;br /&gt;
instantly dragged him from his carriage,&lt;br /&gt;
and buried their poignards in his bosom.&lt;br /&gt;
Thus was the miserable death of this&lt;br /&gt;
wretched being, whose heart was never&lt;br /&gt;
inspired with one sentiment that would&lt;br /&gt;
reflect honour on himself, accomplished by&lt;br /&gt;
the means of his colleague in the attroci-&lt;br /&gt;
ous attempt, to deprive his father of life.&lt;br /&gt;
Such was the end of a life which that one&lt;br /&gt;
crime indeliably stained, and which, had he&lt;br /&gt;
possessed the tallents of the Count de Vau-&lt;br /&gt;
ban, would have been productive of more&lt;br /&gt;
mischief to society. Soon as the murder-&lt;br /&gt;
ers had satiated their revenge and taken&lt;br /&gt;
ample vengeance for the wound he had&lt;br /&gt;
given their comrade, they returned to the&lt;br /&gt;
castle to dispose of the trifling booty they&lt;br /&gt;
had obtained, and convey the wounded ruf-&lt;br /&gt;
fian. The Count possessed sufficient sa-&lt;br /&gt;
gacity to know, that his petty despotism&lt;br /&gt;
would be of short continuance, as the out-&lt;br /&gt;
rages the banditti under his command, had&lt;br /&gt;
committed in the province, much shortly,&lt;br /&gt;
reach the royal ear; and the consequence&lt;br /&gt;
would be fatal to him, but it was too late&lt;br /&gt;
to think of obtaining pardon, and he flatter-&lt;br /&gt;
ed himself that he could make his escape at&lt;br /&gt;
any time, when imperious necessity should&lt;br /&gt;
command such a proceeding. Had the Count&lt;br /&gt;
de Vauban been educated in the principles&lt;br /&gt;
of virtue, he would probably have become&lt;br /&gt;
an ornament to society, but unlimited indul-&lt;br /&gt;
gence had suffered his good qualities to be&lt;br /&gt;
obscured, and by the continued practice of&lt;br /&gt;
engaging in bachanalian festivals and carou-&lt;br /&gt;
sals, his heart became at last as depraved&lt;br /&gt;
as we behold it. When M. Dupont arriv-&lt;br /&gt;
ed at Paris, he made a report to the king&lt;br /&gt;
of the numerous murders and robberies that&lt;br /&gt;
had been committed in the province of&lt;br /&gt;
Burgundy. The Duke of Alencon also,&lt;br /&gt;
who mourned his son cut of in the prime&lt;br /&gt;
of life by the hands of lawless ruffians, was&lt;br /&gt;
determined to destroy the combination of&lt;br /&gt;
the villains who infested this fertile part of&lt;br /&gt;
the kingdom, and revenge the death of his&lt;br /&gt;
son. His influence at court was conside-&lt;br /&gt;
rable, and he was permitted by the king&lt;br /&gt;
to lead a body of the regular troops against&lt;br /&gt;
the Count, to conduct him to the capital&lt;br /&gt;
if he made a voluntary surrender of his&lt;br /&gt;
person or in case of resistance, to destroy&lt;br /&gt;
the haunt of the banditti, and bring him&lt;br /&gt;
to condign punishment. In order to pre-&lt;br /&gt;
vent the escape of the Count, the Duke of&lt;br /&gt;
Alencon, accompanied by Louis Boileau,&lt;br /&gt;
and M. Dupont, with the troops under&lt;br /&gt;
his authority, marched towards the castle&lt;br /&gt;
with rapidity, lest the intelligence of their&lt;br /&gt;
approach should give the alarm, and de&lt;br /&gt;
Vauban escape the fate due to his attroci-&lt;br /&gt;
ous guilt. But all their caution did not&lt;br /&gt;
prevent his receiving notice of their arri-&lt;br /&gt;
val, and acting according to the dictates&lt;br /&gt;
of prudence. With every necessary pre-&lt;br /&gt;
caution to prevent a surprize from the ban-&lt;br /&gt;
ditti, the troops invested the castle, and&lt;br /&gt;
a messenger was dispatched to demand the&lt;br /&gt;
surrender of it to his Majesty’s commission,&lt;br /&gt;
a refusal was the answer, unless the com-&lt;br /&gt;
mandant of the party would pledge his hon-&lt;br /&gt;
our to procure them a free pardon. This&lt;br /&gt;
offer was not accepted, and they were or-&lt;br /&gt;
dered to surrender unconditionally, de-&lt;br /&gt;
pending on the clemency of the king, or&lt;br /&gt;
death was denounced as their portion, the&lt;br /&gt;
instant they were taken. Inflated with&lt;br /&gt;
visionary ideas of the strength of the for-&lt;br /&gt;
tifications, and confident of the plenty&lt;br /&gt;
which abounded from the stores of provi-&lt;br /&gt;
sion, which the provident Count had taken&lt;br /&gt;
care to lay up, they bid defiance to regal&lt;br /&gt;
authority, and dared them to the assault.&lt;br /&gt;
Several petty conflicts were maintained&lt;br /&gt;
with the banditti, who, though inferior in&lt;br /&gt;
point of numbers, counterbalanced it by&lt;br /&gt;
their ferocity, and several were killed on&lt;br /&gt;
either side. To conquer or die, was the&lt;br /&gt;
maxim the ruffian defenders of the castle&lt;br /&gt;
faithfully adhered to, and the soldiers of&lt;br /&gt;
the royal party were unable to obtain any&lt;br /&gt;
advantage. Finding they made but very&lt;br /&gt;
little progress towards the object of their&lt;br /&gt;
excursion, the leaders of the detachment&lt;br /&gt;
determined upon a vigorous attempt to&lt;br /&gt;
overcome all resistance. For this purpose&lt;br /&gt;
they prepared torches and fire-brands, re-&lt;br /&gt;
solved to set fire to the castle, and bury&lt;br /&gt;
its infatuated inhabitants in the ruins. Hu-&lt;br /&gt;
manity however induced them to make a&lt;br /&gt;
final offer of conditional pardon, if they&lt;br /&gt;
would give up the arm of justice the&lt;br /&gt;
Count de Vauban. The proposal was re-&lt;br /&gt;
jected by the banditti with disdain, for al-&lt;br /&gt;
though dead to every sentiment of recti-&lt;br /&gt;
tude and humanity, the imaginary tie of&lt;br /&gt;
honour bound them to the Count, and they&lt;br /&gt;
resolved to procure his pardon or perish&lt;br /&gt;
with him. JULIUS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[7. 13 June 1801]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Continued.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FINDING all attempts to induce the&lt;br /&gt;
banditti to except the intended pardon were&lt;br /&gt;
futile, they prepared to carry the plan of&lt;br /&gt;
burning the castle into execution. Having&lt;br /&gt;
made every necessary preparation, the lead-&lt;br /&gt;
ers of the troops assigned to each the part&lt;br /&gt;
they were to act, and an hour after the sun&lt;br /&gt;
had sunk beneath the horizon, the signal&lt;br /&gt;
for the attack was given, by throwing a&lt;br /&gt;
rocket from the General’s tent. The sol-&lt;br /&gt;
diers rushed forward to the onset, brandish-&lt;br /&gt;
ing their torches, and after a severe conflict,&lt;br /&gt;
gained the out-works of the castle. In a&lt;br /&gt;
short time the conflagration was general,&lt;br /&gt;
and the gleams of light proceeding from it,&lt;br /&gt;
and to the darkness which prevailed, ren-&lt;br /&gt;
dered it a scene of horror. Having accom-&lt;br /&gt;
plished the design of setting the castle on&lt;br /&gt;
fire, the troops retreated to guard all the&lt;br /&gt;
out-lets, that those who escaped the fury&lt;br /&gt;
of the raging element, should fall by the a-&lt;br /&gt;
venging sword. A body of the banditti, with&lt;br /&gt;
the Count at their head, sallied from the&lt;br /&gt;
castle, to endeavour to cut their way thro’&lt;br /&gt;
the hostile party. But the principal part of&lt;br /&gt;
them fell in the attempt, and among them,&lt;br /&gt;
the infamous De Vauban.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Louis as soon as he perceived the flames&lt;br /&gt;
bursting from all parts of the castle, and the&lt;br /&gt;
towering ramparts enveloped in spoke, ap-&lt;br /&gt;
proached the walls: the sally of the bandit-&lt;br /&gt;
ti had been made on a different side, and&lt;br /&gt;
had not attracted his attention from the scene&lt;br /&gt;
of ruin before him. While he was contem-&lt;br /&gt;
plating the destruction which was taking&lt;br /&gt;
place, his attention was arrested by the&lt;br /&gt;
sight of a person leaping from one rampart&lt;br /&gt;
to another, to escape the threatening flames&lt;br /&gt;
which pursued him, and in which he ap-&lt;br /&gt;
peared to be almost involved. At length,&lt;br /&gt;
by means of his surprising activity, he ap-&lt;br /&gt;
proached towards the place where Louis&lt;br /&gt;
stood, but still at such a height, that his es-&lt;br /&gt;
cape seemed almost impossible. He had&lt;br /&gt;
considerably descended since Louis first&lt;br /&gt;
noticed him, and now paused, apparent-&lt;br /&gt;
ly contemplating his height from the&lt;br /&gt;
ground, and dubious of his ability to reach&lt;br /&gt;
it in safety. But the flames approached,&lt;br /&gt;
he sprung from the walls, and fell almost at&lt;br /&gt;
the feet of Louis, who raised his arm to&lt;br /&gt;
terminate his life, but an impulse of huma-&lt;br /&gt;
nity induced him to spare it, if indeed he&lt;br /&gt;
had not been killed by the fall. Young Boi-&lt;br /&gt;
leau laid his hand on his heart, and felt it&lt;br /&gt;
beat. The horizon was illuminated by the&lt;br /&gt;
conflagration, and as he inclined himself,&lt;br /&gt;
to see if the spark of life was extinguished,&lt;br /&gt;
he observed the stranger was dressed differ-&lt;br /&gt;
ently from the common banditti. Strange&lt;br /&gt;
emotions agitated his bosom, and “hope,&lt;br /&gt;
the fond deceiver,” fluttered round his&lt;br /&gt;
heart. He approached to inspect the fig-&lt;br /&gt;
ure which lay prostrate before him, cover-&lt;br /&gt;
ed with dust, and stunned with the fall.&lt;br /&gt;
He gently raised him from the ground, and&lt;br /&gt;
as the light gleamed on his ashy counte-&lt;br /&gt;
nance, discovered him to be–HIS LONG&lt;br /&gt;
LOST BROTHER!—-Reader, conceive his&lt;br /&gt;
sensations, for words cannot express them;&lt;br /&gt;
no language could convey them to thee,&lt;br /&gt;
though all the eloquence of TULLY was&lt;br /&gt;
exhausted to effect it. His astonishment&lt;br /&gt;
almost surpassed conception–Had he not&lt;br /&gt;
beheld him prostrate on the floor of his cell,&lt;br /&gt;
his life’s blood streaming from his bosom?–&lt;br /&gt;
Had he not seen him a palled corpse, the&lt;br /&gt;
victim of fell revenge?–And now, did he&lt;br /&gt;
not see him before him? did not his arms&lt;br /&gt;
support him?–All that had passed ap-&lt;br /&gt;
peared as a fearful dream, the offspring of&lt;br /&gt;
a disordered fancy. He called loudly for&lt;br /&gt;
assistance, and had him conveyed to his&lt;br /&gt;
tent, where they successfully endeavoured&lt;br /&gt;
to restore l1im to existence, but he had re-&lt;br /&gt;
ceived some very severe contusions from the&lt;br /&gt;
fall, and his arm appeared considerably&lt;br /&gt;
scorched.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, as soon as the dawn oppo-&lt;br /&gt;
sed its pleasing light to the more awful ap-&lt;br /&gt;
pearance of the castle, which exhibited one&lt;br /&gt;
vast sheet of flame, our new-found invalid&lt;br /&gt;
was conveyed to the hospitable mansion of&lt;br /&gt;
Monsieur Burton, where M. Dupont and&lt;br /&gt;
Louis were kindly urged to take up their&lt;br /&gt;
residence. A few weeks crowned the as-&lt;br /&gt;
siduities of the amiable surgeon and his&lt;br /&gt;
friends with success, and they had the in-&lt;br /&gt;
expressible satisfaction of seeing their be-&lt;br /&gt;
loved Henry, whom they very naturally had&lt;br /&gt;
long concluded, was traversing the regions&lt;br /&gt;
of eternity, restored to all his former health&lt;br /&gt;
and vigour. Happiness they yet hoped was&lt;br /&gt;
in store for them, since De Vauban, the&lt;br /&gt;
grand and only enemy to their happiness,&lt;br /&gt;
had fell the victim to the justice of his of-&lt;br /&gt;
fended country. Carrying his resentment&lt;br /&gt;
no farther than to see the execution of jus-&lt;br /&gt;
tice on the vile disturbers of the public tran-&lt;br /&gt;
quility, the Duke of Alencon, with his usu-&lt;br /&gt;
al humanity, ordered that the bodies of the&lt;br /&gt;
banditti should receive decent burial, and&lt;br /&gt;
every rite be performed, that, according&lt;br /&gt;
to the forms of the Romish church, was ne-&lt;br /&gt;
cessary to remove all obstacles from their&lt;br /&gt;
road to heaven. Soon as the bodies of these&lt;br /&gt;
infatuated wretches were committed to the&lt;br /&gt;
embraces of their mother earth, the troops&lt;br /&gt;
commenced their march, to return to the&lt;br /&gt;
capital, and the Duke retired to his cas-&lt;br /&gt;
tle to receive from the filial assiduities of&lt;br /&gt;
his daughter, consolation for the untimely&lt;br /&gt;
death of his son. Ignorance frequently con-&lt;br /&gt;
duces more to our happiness than knowl-&lt;br /&gt;
edge, and had de Alencon known of the in-&lt;br /&gt;
famous design of his son, he would not&lt;br /&gt;
have stood in need of any consolation. Hen-&lt;br /&gt;
ry upon his restoration to health, complied&lt;br /&gt;
with the desires of his friends, and thus com-&lt;br /&gt;
menced the relation of his misfortunes.&lt;br /&gt;
“You, my kind friends, must certainly&lt;br /&gt;
have been greatly astonished, when you&lt;br /&gt;
found my chamber vacant, and per-&lt;br /&gt;
ceive no traces of my having left the room;&lt;br /&gt;
but your surprise could not have equalled&lt;br /&gt;
mine, when about midnight, without any&lt;br /&gt;
previous noise which would have announced&lt;br /&gt;
the entrance of any person, (especially as&lt;br /&gt;
the door was fastened within) I saw by the&lt;br /&gt;
light the lamp burning in the chimney&lt;br /&gt;
afforded, a man standing by my bed-side. I&lt;br /&gt;
demanded his business in my chamber, at&lt;br /&gt;
such an unseasonable hour, but he instant-&lt;br /&gt;
ly drew a pistol from his pocket, and order-&lt;br /&gt;
ed me to dress immediately, and without&lt;br /&gt;
noise, as the least attempt to alarm the&lt;br /&gt;
family should be attended with death. Re-&lt;br /&gt;
sistance was vain, and I according com-&lt;br /&gt;
plied with his demand in silence: as soon&lt;br /&gt;
as dressing was finished, he bade me attend&lt;br /&gt;
him, and removing a pannel in the parti-&lt;br /&gt;
tion, I discovered a secret-door, which he&lt;br /&gt;
opened, and we passed through. We now&lt;br /&gt;
entered several apartments, which the&lt;br /&gt;
noisome atmosphere, and decayed furniture&lt;br /&gt;
declared had been long deserted, and re-&lt;br /&gt;
signed to the all-destroying hand of time.&lt;br /&gt;
Here, still holding the pistol in his hand,&lt;br /&gt;
he obliged me to walk before him. Before&lt;br /&gt;
we left the building, he was joined by sev-&lt;br /&gt;
eral other ruffians, whose countenances&lt;br /&gt;
plainly denoted their villainous characters,&lt;br /&gt;
and that they were fit instruments to ac-&lt;br /&gt;
complish any design which villainy could&lt;br /&gt;
conceive. When we made an exit from&lt;br /&gt;
the mansion, we found a carriage waiting,&lt;br /&gt;
into which three of the ruffians entered&lt;br /&gt;
with myself. We proceeded with amazing&lt;br /&gt;
rapidity I knew not Whither, but my heart&lt;br /&gt;
sunk within me, at the strange pro-&lt;br /&gt;
ceedings, and mysterious silence of my&lt;br /&gt;
companions: at length the dawn broke up-&lt;br /&gt;
on us, as we attained the summit of a steep&lt;br /&gt;
hill. At any other time, and almost in any&lt;br /&gt;
other situation, I should have beheld the&lt;br /&gt;
surrounding scenery with delight, but my&lt;br /&gt;
mind was a pray to despondency, and the&lt;br /&gt;
most gloomy prospect appeared before me.&lt;br /&gt;
In vain did I request of my companions to&lt;br /&gt;
inform me Whither I was to be led, for they&lt;br /&gt;
preserved a uniform and uninterrupted si-&lt;br /&gt;
lence, except when the leader of the party&lt;br /&gt;
as he appeared to be, cautioned me to make&lt;br /&gt;
no noise, as he said it would be instant-&lt;br /&gt;
neously punished. I could not forbear ta-&lt;br /&gt;
king a retrospective view of the happy past,&lt;br /&gt;
and comparing it with my present forlorn&lt;br /&gt;
situation. Surrounded by ruffians, who it&lt;br /&gt;
was evident, had some villainous design&lt;br /&gt;
upon me, hope almost forsook me, and I&lt;br /&gt;
only beheld in perspective, either a life&lt;br /&gt;
dragged out in chains and misery, or a ter-&lt;br /&gt;
mination to my sufferings, by an untimely&lt;br /&gt;
death. In vain did I pray my companions&lt;br /&gt;
to give me some clue to guide me through&lt;br /&gt;
this labyrinth of uncertainty, they deigned&lt;br /&gt;
not to answer me, unless to reprehend me&lt;br /&gt;
for my loquacity. But why am I thus fa-&lt;br /&gt;
tiguing you with a detail of my sensations,&lt;br /&gt;
during this memorable journey, memorable&lt;br /&gt;
to me, as it will ever be a distinguished&lt;br /&gt;
æra of my life; to be brief, I arrived, after&lt;br /&gt;
a tiresome journey, at the castle, without&lt;br /&gt;
having left the carriage for a moment; as&lt;br /&gt;
provision had been made to avoid the ne-&lt;br /&gt;
cessity. Having alighted from the car-&lt;br /&gt;
riage, I was immediately conducted to the&lt;br /&gt;
dreary dungeon from whence the magna-&lt;br /&gt;
nimity of my beloved brother released me.&lt;br /&gt;
When I was secured by chains in this hor-&lt;br /&gt;
rible place, my guide condescended to open&lt;br /&gt;
his lips, and inform me, that here the re-&lt;br /&gt;
mainder of my days Was to be spent, that&lt;br /&gt;
here I was to drag out in misery; the rem-&lt;br /&gt;
nant of my life, which till then had been spent&lt;br /&gt;
in a course of uninterrupted felicity, ex-&lt;br /&gt;
cept when the death of my father, for a&lt;br /&gt;
time, cast a shade over my happiness. I then&lt;br /&gt;
repeated my request to know by whom,&lt;br /&gt;
and for what motive, I was thus severely&lt;br /&gt;
punished, but I could obtain no answer&lt;br /&gt;
from the monster, and I thought I could&lt;br /&gt;
perceive a horrid smile of satisfaction,&lt;br /&gt;
gleam across his countenance, at having&lt;br /&gt;
thus doomed fellow creature to be mise-&lt;br /&gt;
rable, as long as life remained. From that&lt;br /&gt;
day till the time I was delivered from the&lt;br /&gt;
murderous designs of my enemies, I held&lt;br /&gt;
no converse with any human being, my&lt;br /&gt;
food which was of the most ordinary kind,&lt;br /&gt;
was daily delivered me by one of those vil-&lt;br /&gt;
lains, who had escorted me to the castle.&lt;br /&gt;
Grief and the dampness of my dungeon,&lt;br /&gt;
Was bringing me rapidly to the verge of the&lt;br /&gt;
grave, when Louis intervened and snatched&lt;br /&gt;
me from the jaws of destruction. The pros-&lt;br /&gt;
pect of liberty was now before me, and it is,&lt;br /&gt;
only for the man, who has been as long con-&lt;br /&gt;
fined within the gloomy walls of a dungeon,&lt;br /&gt;
to conceive my sensations. But not long&lt;br /&gt;
was I permitted to indulge the flattering&lt;br /&gt;
hope, as we were so soon taken, and I again&lt;br /&gt;
became the victim of tyranny. To whom&lt;br /&gt;
was to be attributed all my misfortunes, I&lt;br /&gt;
was totally ignorant; but my condition was&lt;br /&gt;
comparatively enviable, to that from which&lt;br /&gt;
I had emerged, as my prison was dry and&lt;br /&gt;
comfortable. The cheering rays of the sun&lt;br /&gt;
penetrated my cell, and to me who had so&lt;br /&gt;
long been deprived of the enlivening sight,&lt;br /&gt;
it was indeed a pleasure. I was but a short&lt;br /&gt;
time oppressed with the weight of my irons,&lt;br /&gt;
for to what motive it was to be attributed&lt;br /&gt;
I know not, but I suppose they conceived&lt;br /&gt;
my escape impossible, and I was suffered&lt;br /&gt;
to enjoy the valuable privilege of traversing&lt;br /&gt;
my narrow cell; my constitution had be-&lt;br /&gt;
come inured to confinement, although the&lt;br /&gt;
disappointment I suffered in being depri-&lt;br /&gt;
ved of the blessings of liberty, when I had&lt;br /&gt;
supposed it within my grasp, did not by&lt;br /&gt;
any means tend to strengthen my patience.&lt;br /&gt;
You have already heard from Louis, of our&lt;br /&gt;
interview in the vaults of the castle, and&lt;br /&gt;
when I was led back to my cell, the hor-&lt;br /&gt;
ror of continual imprisonment, seemed to&lt;br /&gt;
occupy the whole of the dreary prospect.&lt;br /&gt;
Disappointment had soured my temper,&lt;br /&gt;
and I gave myself up a prey to desponden-&lt;br /&gt;
cy. To my repeated requests to receive&lt;br /&gt;
information respecting Louis, my keeper&lt;br /&gt;
used to seldom reply without equivocation,&lt;br /&gt;
and sometimes he would answer in a way&lt;br /&gt;
that roused my passions, dormant only for&lt;br /&gt;
want of something to call them into action;&lt;br /&gt;
one night when he entered my cell, to&lt;br /&gt;
see that every thing was in the situation he&lt;br /&gt;
chose it to be, I inquired after Louis, and his&lt;br /&gt;
answer was accompanied with bitter taunts&lt;br /&gt;
at my defenceless situation. This I sup-&lt;br /&gt;
pose was occasioned by some incident, that&lt;br /&gt;
had occurred to ruffle his temper, and he&lt;br /&gt;
took the opportunity to vent on me his&lt;br /&gt;
spleen. My temper, soured by misfortune,&lt;br /&gt;
was unprepared to endure this new and un-&lt;br /&gt;
provoked treatment, and I heaped on him&lt;br /&gt;
reproaches for his villainy, and bestowed&lt;br /&gt;
on him every term which my resentment&lt;br /&gt;
could suggest. Fired by this unusual retort,&lt;br /&gt;
and stung with my merited reproaches, he&lt;br /&gt;
drew a dagger from his bosom, and dart-&lt;br /&gt;
ed upon me, aimed it at my heart.&lt;br /&gt;
JULIUS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[8. 20 June 1801]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Continued.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ALL conception from this moment failed&lt;br /&gt;
me, and, upon returning to life, I found&lt;br /&gt;
myself on a bed in a cell, similar to that in&lt;br /&gt;
which I had been confined. I was attend-&lt;br /&gt;
ed by some of the ruffians, whose motives&lt;br /&gt;
for their present attention I could not scan.&lt;br /&gt;
Whether they were actuated by humanity,&lt;br /&gt;
or whether remorse had stung the villain&lt;br /&gt;
who had attempted my assassination, I could&lt;br /&gt;
not tell, tho’ from what knowledge of their&lt;br /&gt;
dispositions I had gathered from painful ex-&lt;br /&gt;
perience, I rather supposed it was the re-&lt;br /&gt;
proaches of conscience, not yet grown cal-&lt;br /&gt;
lous by repeated acts of barbarity. To&lt;br /&gt;
whatever cause their conduct was to· be at-&lt;br /&gt;
tributed, whether to sensations of remorse,&lt;br /&gt;
or the dictates of compassion, I was soon&lt;br /&gt;
convinced the sentiment was short-lived, and&lt;br /&gt;
had expired with returning animation; for&lt;br /&gt;
soon as I had emerged from the state of in-&lt;br /&gt;
sensibility into which I had fallen, their as-&lt;br /&gt;
siduities gradually decreased, and my only&lt;br /&gt;
assistance was in the strength of my con-&lt;br /&gt;
stitution, which safely bore me through the&lt;br /&gt;
strange vicissitudes of my fate. My con-&lt;br /&gt;
valescence was tedious and painful; I had&lt;br /&gt;
lost a considerable quantity of blood, which&lt;br /&gt;
occasioned extraordinary debility, and my&lt;br /&gt;
wound was deep. I had received the&lt;br /&gt;
dagger of the assassin in my breast, and&lt;br /&gt;
surely it is to be attributed to the intervene-&lt;br /&gt;
tion of my guardian angel, that I escaped&lt;br /&gt;
the impending destruction. My debility&lt;br /&gt;
was so extreme, that my guards did not&lt;br /&gt;
think it necessary to secure the door with&lt;br /&gt;
more fastenings than a simple bolt, which&lt;br /&gt;
was in itself ample security; for my strength&lt;br /&gt;
and ardour were too much exhausted, to&lt;br /&gt;
make an attempt to regain my liberty, had&lt;br /&gt;
the fairest prospect been opened before me.&lt;br /&gt;
At length the ability of my only nurse,&lt;br /&gt;
“Dame Nature,” restored me by the geni-&lt;br /&gt;
al influence of sleep (the enjoyment of&lt;br /&gt;
which was a pleasure I had not for some&lt;br /&gt;
time been gratified with) to the blessings of&lt;br /&gt;
health. I had scarcely retrieved the posses-&lt;br /&gt;
sion of this glorious blessing, which had&lt;br /&gt;
been so long banished from, when the&lt;br /&gt;
royal troops encompassed the castle, to a-&lt;br /&gt;
venge my wrongs on the author of all my&lt;br /&gt;
misfortunes. I longed for an opportunity&lt;br /&gt;
to join the detachment, and assert my own&lt;br /&gt;
cause,–my ardour disdained to be confin-&lt;br /&gt;
ed within the circumscribed limits of my&lt;br /&gt;
prison, but my power would not second&lt;br /&gt;
the inspiration. The tardy hours seemed&lt;br /&gt;
to have almost ceased to revolve, my heart&lt;br /&gt;
was with my brother, but my arms, which&lt;br /&gt;
ought to have been extended, to hurl the&lt;br /&gt;
bolt of vengeance on the heads of my op-&lt;br /&gt;
pressors, were imprisoned within the walls&lt;br /&gt;
of the hateful castle. At length arrived the&lt;br /&gt;
night Of horror, when the polluted walls of&lt;br /&gt;
the castle, which screened the guilty ruffians&lt;br /&gt;
from the hands of justice tottered to their&lt;br /&gt;
foundations; when the “cloud-cap’t tow-&lt;br /&gt;
ers” trembled with the intensity of the&lt;br /&gt;
heat, and threatened ruin to all beneath&lt;br /&gt;
them. I had notice of the commencement&lt;br /&gt;
of the conflagration by the gleams of light&lt;br /&gt;
which illuminated the horizon, and render-&lt;br /&gt;
ed “darkness, visible.” A horrible death&lt;br /&gt;
was now before me and the innate princi-&lt;br /&gt;
ple, inherent in the breast of man, that&lt;br /&gt;
of self-preservation, induced me to exam-&lt;br /&gt;
ine the door of my apartment. But the faint&lt;br /&gt;
hope, that some one actuated by humanity,&lt;br /&gt;
might have left it unsecured, vanished. The&lt;br /&gt;
flames gradually increased, and already en-&lt;br /&gt;
veloped the towering ramparts, when the&lt;br /&gt;
bustle in the castle announced some uncom-&lt;br /&gt;
mon attempt to escape the devouring ele-&lt;br /&gt;
ment, which was making rapid strides to&lt;br /&gt;
involve the whole of the inhabitants in one&lt;br /&gt;
common destruction. Abhorring a death&lt;br /&gt;
so painful as was presented to me, I endea-&lt;br /&gt;
voured to loosen the bars with which the&lt;br /&gt;
window was secured, and alight on the bat-&lt;br /&gt;
tlements. The urgency of my situation in-&lt;br /&gt;
spired me with uncommon strength,–I suc-&lt;br /&gt;
ceeded in the attempt to escape from the&lt;br /&gt;
window, and reached the battlements in&lt;br /&gt;
safety. I was nearly at the summit of&lt;br /&gt;
the castle, and all below me was involved&lt;br /&gt;
in smoke, from which at intervals the flames&lt;br /&gt;
would burst forth, and aspire to the high-&lt;br /&gt;
est turrets. Perseverance and composure,&lt;br /&gt;
aided by my exertions, surmounted every&lt;br /&gt;
obstacle, and I at length reached the ground,&lt;br /&gt;
with only a trifling burn I received as I rush-&lt;br /&gt;
ed through the flames. Thus, my kind and&lt;br /&gt;
compassionate friends, you have heard the&lt;br /&gt;
whole of my unfortunate story in detail,&lt;br /&gt;
and situated as I now am, surrounded by&lt;br /&gt;
those who endear existence to me, I defy&lt;br /&gt;
all the storms of fate, and the frowns of&lt;br /&gt;
fortune, Hope befriends me, and whis-&lt;br /&gt;
pers to my heart, That happiness shall a-&lt;br /&gt;
gain be mine.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tranquillity being thus restored to&lt;br /&gt;
the family of Dupont and his wards, whom&lt;br /&gt;
he regarded with paternal love, the chateau&lt;br /&gt;
was re-occupied, and Louis made an ex-&lt;br /&gt;
cursion to the Castle de Alencon, where&lt;br /&gt;
he was received with an unaffected wel-&lt;br /&gt;
come. No obstacle recurring to oppose&lt;br /&gt;
his wish, to pay his addresses to the love-&lt;br /&gt;
ly Antoinette, he took the first opportuni-&lt;br /&gt;
ty of a secret interview, to offer his heart&lt;br /&gt;
and hand to her acceptance. Free from&lt;br /&gt;
affectation, Mademoiselle de Lantz avow-&lt;br /&gt;
ed a reciprocal attachment, and soon as&lt;br /&gt;
the period of mourning, which the laws of&lt;br /&gt;
etiquette required, for her brother’s death,&lt;br /&gt;
had expired, they were united in the silken&lt;br /&gt;
bands of marriage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Duke with rapture beheld the hap-&lt;br /&gt;
piness his beloved children enjoyed, and,&lt;br /&gt;
through his influence with the King, the&lt;br /&gt;
succession to his titles and estates, were&lt;br /&gt;
settled upon Louis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The humane surgeon, of whom honour-&lt;br /&gt;
able mention has been made, had only one&lt;br /&gt;
surviving daughter, whose charms made an&lt;br /&gt;
impression on the susceptible heart of Hen-&lt;br /&gt;
ry Boileau, that was not to be effaced.&lt;br /&gt;
The attachment was mutual, and much to&lt;br /&gt;
the satisfaction of their friends, whose in-&lt;br /&gt;
timacy would be cemented by their union.&lt;br /&gt;
Large additions were made to the Chat-&lt;br /&gt;
eau, and in this delightful retirement, far&lt;br /&gt;
distant from the busy and tumultuous&lt;br /&gt;
scenes of life, the Duke of Alencon, Mons.&lt;br /&gt;
Berton, Louis (now Count de Vauban) his&lt;br /&gt;
brother Henry, and the venerable Mons.&lt;br /&gt;
Dupont, with their respective families,&lt;br /&gt;
passed the remainder of their lives, in the&lt;br /&gt;
enjoyment of a greater portion of felicity,&lt;br /&gt;
than is the usual lot of mankind. No tales&lt;br /&gt;
of woe, no descriptive scenes of carnage and&lt;br /&gt;
bloodshed, ever disturbed their tranquillity,&lt;br /&gt;
but possessing within themselves inexhaust-&lt;br /&gt;
ible resources of amusement, they lived&lt;br /&gt;
insulated from the rest of mankind. No&lt;br /&gt;
foe to domestic tranquility, ever passed&lt;br /&gt;
their threshold, no intestine uneasiness in-&lt;br /&gt;
habited their retirement, but as far as pos-&lt;br /&gt;
sible for humanity, they enjoyed &lt;em&gt;perma-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;nent and unalloyed happiness&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
HAVING brought this story too close, it&lt;br /&gt;
may not be superfluous to account for the&lt;br /&gt;
author’s adding this to the multitude of si-&lt;br /&gt;
milar trifles, with which the literary world&lt;br /&gt;
abounds. He is confident, that attempts&lt;br /&gt;
of this kind, are productive of nothing but&lt;br /&gt;
amusement, and are frequently barren even&lt;br /&gt;
of this. Tales, (unless moral,) novels, and&lt;br /&gt;
romances are justly considered as weeds&lt;br /&gt;
in the garden of literature, which prevent&lt;br /&gt;
the growth of, and attract the attention&lt;br /&gt;
from, more useful productions. To drive&lt;br /&gt;
away the &lt;em&gt;monster ennύi&lt;/em&gt;, to pass away those&lt;br /&gt;
hours of leisure, which fall to the lot of&lt;br /&gt;
every one, and to derive from it amusement,&lt;br /&gt;
were the motives by which he was actua-&lt;br /&gt;
ted. He does not pretend that it incul-&lt;br /&gt;
cates any new moral, but if he may be ex-&lt;br /&gt;
onerated from censure, in increasing the&lt;br /&gt;
number or works of this kind, if it has con-&lt;br /&gt;
duced to the amusement of any, he is satis-&lt;br /&gt;
fied. Approbation he does not court, but&lt;br /&gt;
to incur censure he has strove to avoid,&lt;br /&gt;
and he hopes that this tale will find refuge&lt;br /&gt;
in its insignificance from the penetrating&lt;br /&gt;
eye of criticism. JULIUS&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[JULIUS is entitled to thanks of the editor, for the&lt;br /&gt;
punctuality with which he has forwarded the copy of&lt;br /&gt;
the Adventures in a castle–That the literary world a-&lt;br /&gt;
bounds with the trifles of this kind is true; and this, no&lt;br /&gt;
doubt, in some measure, forms a criterion by which to&lt;br /&gt;
judge of the taste of the age; tho’ a taste of this kind&lt;br /&gt;
of reading, is not, perhaps, peculiar to the present one.&lt;br /&gt;
The story under consideration inculcates a moral, if not&lt;br /&gt;
new, yet good–Avarice, stimulating to treachery and a&lt;br /&gt;
variety of vicious a??s, in the person of the Count de&lt;br /&gt;
Vauban, meets with the deserved punishment: while the&lt;br /&gt;
innocent objects of his horrid persecution, are extricated&lt;br /&gt;
from his cruel fangs, and finally brought to the enjoy-&lt;br /&gt;
ment of more perfect domestic felicity, than they would&lt;br /&gt;
otherwise probably have attained, had it not been for&lt;br /&gt;
those very circumstances to which his machinations gave&lt;br /&gt;
birth–corroborating a divine truth, that the wicked are&lt;br /&gt;
often snared in their own devices. The reader will&lt;br /&gt;
also observe, (and it does credit to the writer,) that the&lt;br /&gt;
the language is free from those passionate exclamations,&lt;br /&gt;
that often insinuate a degree of profanity into the mind,&lt;br /&gt;
and with which tales and novels frequently abound,&lt;br /&gt;
Should Julius continue his correspondence, as he has&lt;br /&gt;
hinted to the editor may be the case, he will always meet&lt;br /&gt;
with merited attention.]&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Early American Serialized Novels</name></author><summary type="html">On This Page</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The History Of Maria Kittle</title><link href="https://earlyamericanserializednovels.github.io/the-history-of-maria-kittle/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The History Of Maria Kittle" /><published>1790-09-01T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>1790-09-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://earlyamericanserializednovels.github.io/the-history-of-maria-kittle</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://earlyamericanserializednovels.github.io/the-history-of-maria-kittle/">&lt;nav class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preface&quot;&gt;Preface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine, or Literary Repository&lt;/em&gt; (1790-1797) was one of the longest running American magazines of the 1700s and is commonly studied because of its status as a particularly influential periodical of the early republic. It was in print for 8 years and had almost 100 issues. It published accounts of theater performances and travel as well as current events and extracts of essays and creative works. The publishers were Thomas and James Swords of New York, who published two other Christian journals around the same time and printed bound books as well. The &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt;’s overall contents are eclectic and seem to claim a curatorship of the interests of the intellectual elite, including George Washington and John Adams. However, the subscription list reveals a varied readership, about half of whom were artisans and shopkeepers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The History of Maria Kittle&lt;/em&gt; was first serialized in the &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt; from September 1790 to January 1791, with each update appearing monthly for a total of five installments. The magazine also published some of Bleecker’s other work, especially poetry; however, each piece was submitted by Bleecker’s daughter Margaretta V. Faugeres several years after her mother’s death. T. and J. Swords, went on to publish the &lt;em&gt;Posthumous Works of Ann Eliza Bleecker, in Prose and Verse&lt;/em&gt; in bound form in 1793, which included &lt;em&gt;The History of Maria Kittle,&lt;/em&gt; another unfinished historical novel called &lt;em&gt;The History of Henry and Ann&lt;/em&gt;, a collection of poetry and letters, and some of Margaretta’s own literary work. Because of its immense popularity, &lt;em&gt;The History of Maria Kittle&lt;/em&gt; was finally republished separately in its own volume in 1797 by Elisha Babcock of Hartford, Connecticut. There is very little difference between the text published in the magazine and stand-alone novel versions of the tale, beyond minor editorial revisions. Interestingly, a nineteenth-century New York women’s magazine called &lt;em&gt;The Ladies’ Literary Cabinet, Being a Repository of Miscellaneous Literary Productions, both Original and Selected in Prose and Verse&lt;/em&gt; (1819-1822) republished the novel in serial form beginning in 1821. It was common practice to republish work this way, and &lt;em&gt;The History of Maria Kittle&lt;/em&gt; may have appeared in other periodicals as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The History of Maria Kittle&lt;/em&gt; is often described as the first captivity novel because it utilizes the captivity narrative form without a solid basis on actual experience. This is ironic given the opening lines of the novel. Thereare claims that the novel is based on the actual experiences of Maria Kittle or Kittlehyun, whose family lived in the same region as the Bleeckers, and whose captivity narrative can be corroborated by an account with similar detail in another memoir. However, the text of the novel emphasizes several other themes independent of historical fidelity, leaving room for a more creative retelling. One of its major themes, conflict between native and colonial Americans, had major impact on the way other writers dealt with the issue. For example, Bleecker may have influenced Cooper’s approach to Native Americans in &lt;em&gt;The Last of the Mohicans&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bleecker’s novel adopts many of the literary tropes of her time, including the captivity narrative, epistolary structure, reliance on the power of sentiment, religious didacticism, elegiac verse, and the domestic manifestation of national politics. The plot reflects Maria Kittle’s capture by Native Americans at the time of the French and Indian War, the loss of most her family including her two young children to the violence of her abductors, their flight to Montreal where she is revived by a circle of sympathetic English and French women, and her eventual miraculous reunion with her husband. The treatment of the Native American characters is very stereotypical. She depicts them as untrustworthy, brutal savages who murder women and children. However, the combination of Maria Kittle’s account and Bleecker’s own life experience during the Revolutionary War leads to an overall meditation on loss in the novel, especially feminine, maternal loss, and the comfort of female fellowship. The displacement of the conflict Bleecker herself experienced onto Maria Kittle’s situation among her Indian neighbors leads to the foregrounding of women’s issues in the politics of early America and white women’s role in nation building. Her story examines the emotional trauma of collateral damage, especially as a woman effected by the conflicts of early America.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though few scholars have analyzed Bleecker’s work at length, and those who have focus mainly on her pastoral poetry or the historical significance of her work and its politics, especially her treatment of Native Americans, very few if any critics have discussed the significance of the novel’s original and continued serialization. This leaves several intriguing questions unanswered. For example: What made this tale such a good fit for this magazine and its readership? Also, further research should be done on the way each installment can be read in isolation from the others, in context of the other work published in the magazine, and in relation to the layers of time it represents from its authorship in 1779 to its depiction of pre-revolution events and relevance to the conditions of the time of publication and republication. The novel is depicted here as it appeared in the &lt;em&gt;New York Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, its first publication, in order to foster further answers to these questions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Biography of Ann Bleeker&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ann Bleeker was born Anna Elizabeth Schuyler around October 1752 as the sixth child of Margareta Van Wyck and BrandtSchuyler, prosperous Dutch merchants and aristocrats of New York City.Her father Brandt Schuyler died shortly before she was born, and her mother married Anthony Ten Eyck in 1760. Their daughter Susanna is the addressee of Ann’s epistolary captivity novel &lt;em&gt;The History of Maria Kittle.&lt;/em&gt; Ann married into another prominent Dutch family in 1769, becoming the wife of lawyer John James Bleecker, who encouraged her writing. They moved to Tomhanick, a more agricultural region near Albany, in 1771, which inspired much of Ann’s pastoral poetry. The Bleeckers had two daughters. The eldest, Margaretta, also became a writer and was responsible for publishing most of her mother’s work. The younger daughter Abella died of dysentery in 1777 during the Revolutionary War when the family was forced to flee their home in Tomhanick because the British General Burgoyne’s troops were invading the area from the North. Ann saw her mother die during the flight southward, and then her sister Caty Swits died on the return journey. Ann, her daughter Margaretta, and a mullato girl survived. John Bleecker was absent for the entire episode, fighting for the militia in support of the revolution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At home again in 1779, Ann produced a periodical called the &lt;em&gt;Albany Gazette&lt;/em&gt; filled with her own essays and poetry for her family and friends to read. This highlights the significance of the periodical genre to early Americans and to Bleecker specifically. However, much of her writing after so much personal loss, including the novel transcribed here, dealt with grief. Unfortunately, Ann’s husband, who continued in the militia, was captured in 1781, and Ann suffered a miscarriage and mental breakdown in shock. Her husband was rescued quickly, but she never completely regained her spirits and died November 23, 1783.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In &lt;em&gt;The History of Maria Kittle&lt;/em&gt;, Bleecker deals specifically with mothers mourning the loss of their children and other family members in times of violence. However, by using the structure of a captivity narrative and the setting of the French and Indian War, the novel explores this theme while vilifying Native Americans rather than the British. This trend of scapegoating and demonizing Native Americans continued into the nineteenth century. Although, Bleecker herself did not live to see much peace in the newly formed United States, her words survived to comfort, entertain and challenge other citizens of the new nation. Though her novel and other work enjoyed enormous popularity in the early republic, it went out of fashion until more recent scholars went looking for alternative perspectives of American history and early examples of the American novel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An original and interesting letter, by the late Mrs. Ann E. Bleecker, to&lt;br /&gt;
her friend Miss S. T. E. describing the sufferings of Mr. Kittle’s fa-&lt;br /&gt;
mily, at Schochticook, in the French and English war, prior to the&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HISTORY OF MARIA KITTLE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Susan,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOWEVER fond of novels and&lt;br /&gt;
romances you may be, the un-&lt;br /&gt;
fortunate adventures of one of my&lt;br /&gt;
neighbours, who died yesterday, will&lt;br /&gt;
make you despise that fiction, in&lt;br /&gt;
which, knowing the subject to be fa-&lt;br /&gt;
bulous, we can never be so truly in-&lt;br /&gt;
terested. While this lady was expir-&lt;br /&gt;
ing, Mrs. C– V–, her near&lt;br /&gt;
kinswoman, related to me her unhap-&lt;br /&gt;
py history, in which I shall now take&lt;br /&gt;
the liberty of interesting your bene-&lt;br /&gt;
volent and feeling heart.–&lt;br /&gt;
Maria Kittle was the only issue of&lt;br /&gt;
her parents, who cultivated a large&lt;br /&gt;
farm on the banks of Hudson, eigh-&lt;br /&gt;
teen miles above Albany. They were&lt;br /&gt;
persons of good natural abilities, im-&lt;br /&gt;
proved by some learning; yet, con-&lt;br /&gt;
scious of a deficiency in their educa-&lt;br /&gt;
tion, they studied nothing so much&lt;br /&gt;
as to render their little daughter truly&lt;br /&gt;
accomplished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maria was born in the year 1721.&lt;br /&gt;
Her promising infancy presaged a ma-&lt;br /&gt;
turity of excellencies; every amiable&lt;br /&gt;
quality dawned through her lisping&lt;br /&gt;
prattle; every personal grace attend-&lt;br /&gt;
ed her attitudes and played over her&lt;br /&gt;
features. As she advanced through&lt;br /&gt;
the playful stage of childhood, she&lt;br /&gt;
became more eminent than a Pene-&lt;br /&gt;
lope for her industry; yet, soon as the&lt;br /&gt;
sun declined, she always retired with&lt;br /&gt;
her books until the time of repose,&lt;br /&gt;
by which means she soon informed&lt;br /&gt;
her opening mind with the princi-&lt;br /&gt;
ples of every useful science. She was&lt;br /&gt;
beloved by all her female companions,&lt;br /&gt;
who, though they easily discovered&lt;br /&gt;
her superior elegance of manners,&lt;br /&gt;
instead of envying, were excited to&lt;br /&gt;
imitate her. As she always made one&lt;br /&gt;
in their little parties of pleasure on&lt;br /&gt;
festival days, it is no wonder that she&lt;br /&gt;
soon became the reigning goddess&lt;br /&gt;
among the swains. She was impor-&lt;br /&gt;
tuned to admit the addresses of num-&lt;br /&gt;
bers, whom she politely discarded,&lt;br /&gt;
and withdrew herself a while from&lt;br /&gt;
public observation. However, the&lt;br /&gt;
fame of her charms attracted several&lt;br /&gt;
gentlemen of family from Albany,&lt;br /&gt;
who intruded on her retirement, so-&lt;br /&gt;
liciting her hand. But this happi-&lt;br /&gt;
ness was reserved for a near relation&lt;br /&gt;
of her’s, one Mr. Kittle, whose me-&lt;br /&gt;
rits had made an impression on her&lt;br /&gt;
heart. He, although not handsome,&lt;br /&gt;
was possessed of a most engaging ad-&lt;br /&gt;
dress, while his learning and moral&lt;br /&gt;
virtues more particularly recommend-&lt;br /&gt;
ed him to her esteem. Their parents&lt;br /&gt;
soon discovered their reciprocal pas-&lt;br /&gt;
sion, and highly approving of it, has-&lt;br /&gt;
tened their marriage, which was ce-&lt;br /&gt;
lebrated under the most happy au-&lt;br /&gt;
spices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maria was fifteen when married.&lt;br /&gt;
They removed to his farm, on which&lt;br /&gt;
he had built a small neat house, sur-&lt;br /&gt;
rounded by tall cedars, which gave it&lt;br /&gt;
a contemplative air. It was situated&lt;br /&gt;
on an eminence, with a green enclo-&lt;br /&gt;
sure in the front; graced by a well-&lt;br /&gt;
cultivated garden on one side, and on&lt;br /&gt;
the other by a clear stream, which,&lt;br /&gt;
rushing over a bed of white pebble,&lt;br /&gt;
gave them a high polish, that cast a&lt;br /&gt;
soft gleam through the water.&lt;br /&gt;
Here they resided in the tranquil&lt;br /&gt;
enjoyment of that happiness which so&lt;br /&gt;
much merit and innocence deserved;&lt;br /&gt;
the indigent, the sorrowful, the un-&lt;br /&gt;
fortunate, were always sure of con-&lt;br /&gt;
solation when they entered those&lt;br /&gt;
peaceful doors. They were almost&lt;br /&gt;
adored by their neighbours, and even&lt;br /&gt;
the wild savages themselves, who of-&lt;br /&gt;
ten resorted thither for refreshments,&lt;br /&gt;
when hunting, expressed the greatest&lt;br /&gt;
regard for them, and admiration of&lt;br /&gt;
their virtues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In little more than a year they&lt;br /&gt;
were blessed with a daughter, the&lt;br /&gt;
lovelier resemblance of her lovely&lt;br /&gt;
mother; as she grew up her graces in­&lt;br /&gt;
creasing, promised a bloom and un-&lt;br /&gt;
derstanding equal to her’s; the Indi-&lt;br /&gt;
ans, in particular, were extremely&lt;br /&gt;
fond of the smiling Anna; whenever&lt;br /&gt;
they found a young fawn, or caught&lt;br /&gt;
a brood of wood-ducks, or surprised&lt;br /&gt;
the young beaver in their daily ex-&lt;br /&gt;
cursions through the forests, they pre-&lt;br /&gt;
sented them with pleasure to her;&lt;br /&gt;
they brought her the earliest straw-&lt;br /&gt;
berries, the scarlet plumb, and other&lt;br /&gt;
delicate wild fruits, in painted bas-&lt;br /&gt;
kets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did the fond parents’ hearts&lt;br /&gt;
delight to see their beloved one so&lt;br /&gt;
universally caressed? When they&lt;br /&gt;
sauntered over the vernal fields with&lt;br /&gt;
the little prattler wantoning before&lt;br /&gt;
them collecting flowers, and pursu-&lt;br /&gt;
ing the velvet elusive butterfly, Ma-&lt;br /&gt;
ria’s cheek suffusing with rapture,&lt;br /&gt;
“oh, my dear!” she would say, “we&lt;br /&gt;
are happier than human beings can&lt;br /&gt;
expect to be; how trivial are the evils&lt;br /&gt;
annexed to our situation? may God&lt;br /&gt;
avert that our Heaven be limited to&lt;br /&gt;
this life!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eleven years now elapsed before&lt;br /&gt;
Mrs. Kittle discovered any signs of&lt;br /&gt;
pregnancy; her spouse silently wish-&lt;br /&gt;
ed for a son, and his desires were at&lt;br /&gt;
length gratified; she was delivered of&lt;br /&gt;
a charming boy, who was named,&lt;br /&gt;
after him, William.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A French and Indian war had&lt;br /&gt;
commenced sometime before, but&lt;br /&gt;
about eight months after her delivery,&lt;br /&gt;
the savages began to commit the most&lt;br /&gt;
horrid depredations on the English&lt;br /&gt;
frontiers. Mr. Kittle, alarmed at&lt;br /&gt;
the danger of his brother, who dwelt&lt;br /&gt;
near Fort-Edward, (the eldest being&lt;br /&gt;
just married to a very agreeable young&lt;br /&gt;
woman) invited them to reside with&lt;br /&gt;
him during the war.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They were scarce arrived when the&lt;br /&gt;
enemy made farther incursions in the&lt;br /&gt;
country, burning the villages, and&lt;br /&gt;
scalping the inhabitants, neither re-&lt;br /&gt;
specting age or sex. This terribly&lt;br /&gt;
alarmed Mrs. Kittle; she began to&lt;br /&gt;
prepare for flight, and the next even-&lt;br /&gt;
ing after receiving this intelligence,&lt;br /&gt;
as she and Mr. Kittle were busily em-&lt;br /&gt;
ployed in packing up china and other&lt;br /&gt;
things, they were accosted by several&lt;br /&gt;
Indians, whose wigwams were con-&lt;br /&gt;
tiguous to the village of Schochti-&lt;br /&gt;
cook, and who always seemed well&lt;br /&gt;
affected to the English. An elderly&lt;br /&gt;
savage undertook to be prolocutor, and&lt;br /&gt;
desired the family to compose them-&lt;br /&gt;
selves, assuring them they should be&lt;br /&gt;
cautioned against any approaching&lt;br /&gt;
danger. To inforce his argument,&lt;br /&gt;
he presented Maria with a belt inter-&lt;br /&gt;
woven with silk and beads, saying,&lt;br /&gt;
“there, receive my token of friend-&lt;br /&gt;
ship.–we go to dig up the hatchet,&lt;br /&gt;
to sink it in the heads of your ene-&lt;br /&gt;
mies: we shall guard this wood with&lt;br /&gt;
a wall of fire–you shall be safe.” A&lt;br /&gt;
warm glow of hope deepened in Ma-&lt;br /&gt;
ria’s cheek at this. Then ordering&lt;br /&gt;
wine to be brought to the friendly&lt;br /&gt;
savages, with a smile of diffidence,&lt;br /&gt;
“I am afraid,” said she, “necessity&lt;br /&gt;
may oblige you to abandon us, or&lt;br /&gt;
neglect of your promise may deprive&lt;br /&gt;
us of your protection.”–“Neglect&lt;br /&gt;
of my promise,” retorted he with&lt;br /&gt;
some acrimony, “no, Maria, I am&lt;br /&gt;
a true man; I shoot the arrow up to&lt;br /&gt;
the Great Captain every new moon:&lt;br /&gt;
depend upon it I will trample down&lt;br /&gt;
the briers round your dwelling, that&lt;br /&gt;
you do not hurt your feet.” Maria&lt;br /&gt;
now retired, bowing a grateful ac-&lt;br /&gt;
knowledgment, and leaving the sa-&lt;br /&gt;
vages to indulge their festivity, who&lt;br /&gt;
passed the night in the most vocife-&lt;br /&gt;
rous mirth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Kittle with a sort of exulta-&lt;br /&gt;
tion, related the subject of their con-&lt;br /&gt;
ference to her husband, who had ab-&lt;br /&gt;
sented himself on their first appear-&lt;br /&gt;
ance, having formed some suspicion&lt;br /&gt;
of the sincerity of their friendship,&lt;br /&gt;
and not being willing to be duped by&lt;br /&gt;
their dissimulation. “And now,”&lt;br /&gt;
added Maria, smiling, “our fears&lt;br /&gt;
may again subside: oh! my dear,&lt;br /&gt;
my happiness is trebled into rapture,&lt;br /&gt;
by seeing you and my sweet babes&lt;br /&gt;
out of danger.” He only sighed,&lt;br /&gt;
and reaching his arm round her po-&lt;br /&gt;
lished neck, pressed her to his bosom.&lt;br /&gt;
After a short pause, “my love,” said&lt;br /&gt;
he, “be not too confident of their&lt;br /&gt;
fidelity, you surely know what a small&lt;br /&gt;
dependence is to be placed in their&lt;br /&gt;
promises; however, to appear suspi-&lt;br /&gt;
cious, might be suddenly fatal to us,&lt;br /&gt;
we will therefore suspend our jour-&lt;br /&gt;
ney to Albany for a few days.”–&lt;br /&gt;
Though Maria’s soul saddened at the&lt;br /&gt;
conviction of this truth; though her&lt;br /&gt;
fears again urged her to propose im-&lt;br /&gt;
mediate flight, yet she acquiesced;&lt;br /&gt;
and having supped with the family,&lt;br /&gt;
this tender pair sunk asleep on the&lt;br /&gt;
bosom of rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early the next morning Mr. Kittle&lt;br /&gt;
arose; first impressing a kiss on Maria’s&lt;br /&gt;
soft cheek, as she slumbered with her&lt;br /&gt;
infant in her arms. He then awak-&lt;br /&gt;
ed his brother, reminding him that&lt;br /&gt;
he had proposed a hunting match the&lt;br /&gt;
preceding evening. “It is true,”&lt;br /&gt;
replied Peter, “but since hostilities&lt;br /&gt;
have commenced so near us as the&lt;br /&gt;
Indians inform, I think it rather im-&lt;br /&gt;
prudent to quit the family.”–&lt;br /&gt;
“Come, come,” replied the other,&lt;br /&gt;
“do not let us intimidate the neigh­&lt;br /&gt;
bours by cloistering ourselves up with&lt;br /&gt;
women and children.”–“I reject&lt;br /&gt;
the thought,” rejoined Peter, “of&lt;br /&gt;
being afraid.” Then having dressed&lt;br /&gt;
himself, while his brother charged&lt;br /&gt;
their pieces, they left the house, and&lt;br /&gt;
traversed the pathless grass for many&lt;br /&gt;
hours without perceiving any thing&lt;br /&gt;
but small birds, who filled the fra-&lt;br /&gt;
grant air with melody. “Peter,”&lt;br /&gt;
said Mr. Kittle, casting his eyes a-&lt;br /&gt;
round the lovely landscape, “what&lt;br /&gt;
a profusion of sweets does nature ex-&lt;br /&gt;
hale to please her intelligent creatures.&lt;br /&gt;
I feel my heart expand with love and&lt;br /&gt;
gratitude to Heaven every moment,&lt;br /&gt;
nor can I ever be grateful enough. I&lt;br /&gt;
have health and competence, a lovely&lt;br /&gt;
fond wife, whose smile would calm&lt;br /&gt;
the rudest storm of passion, and two&lt;br /&gt;
infants blossoming into perfection;&lt;br /&gt;
all my social ties are yet unbroken–&lt;br /&gt;
Peter, I anticipate my Heaven–!&lt;br /&gt;
But why, my brother, do you turn&lt;br /&gt;
pale? what dreadful idea stiffens&lt;br /&gt;
your features with amazement? what&lt;br /&gt;
in God’s name ails you, Peter, are&lt;br /&gt;
you unwell? sit down under this tree&lt;br /&gt;
awhile.”–To these interrogatories&lt;br /&gt;
Peter replied, “excuse my weakness,&lt;br /&gt;
I am not unwell, but an unusual&lt;br /&gt;
horror chilled my blood; I felt as if&lt;br /&gt;
the damps of death prest already&lt;br /&gt;
round my soul; but the vapour is&lt;br /&gt;
gone off again, I feel quite better.”&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Kittle cheered his brother, attri-&lt;br /&gt;
buting his emotion to fear, who, by&lt;br /&gt;
this time, having reassumed his com-&lt;br /&gt;
posure, entered into discourse with&lt;br /&gt;
cheerfulness, refusing to return home&lt;br /&gt;
without having killed any thing.&lt;br /&gt;
Then rising, they proceeded thro’&lt;br /&gt;
lofty groves of pine, and open fields,&lt;br /&gt;
that seemed to bend under the heavy&lt;br /&gt;
hand of Ceres. At last, disappoint-&lt;br /&gt;
ment and fatigue prevailed on them&lt;br /&gt;
to return home; they had gone far-&lt;br /&gt;
ther than they apprehended; but&lt;br /&gt;
passing along the bank of the river,&lt;br /&gt;
within a few miles of Mr. Kittle’s,&lt;br /&gt;
they espied a fat doe walking secure-&lt;br /&gt;
ly on the beach, which Peter softly&lt;br /&gt;
approaching, levelled his piece with&lt;br /&gt;
so good an aim, that the animal drop-&lt;br /&gt;
ped. Instantly at the explosion, this&lt;br /&gt;
seeming success was, however, the&lt;br /&gt;
origin of their calamities; for imme-&lt;br /&gt;
diately after two savages appeared,&lt;br /&gt;
directed in their course by the firing.&lt;br /&gt;
Setting up a loud yell, they ran up&lt;br /&gt;
to the brothers and discharged their&lt;br /&gt;
fire arms. Mr. Kittle started back,&lt;br /&gt;
but Peter received a brace of balls in&lt;br /&gt;
his bosom. He recoiled a few steps&lt;br /&gt;
back, and then sunk down income-&lt;br /&gt;
passed by those deadly horrors of&lt;br /&gt;
which in the morning he had a pre-&lt;br /&gt;
sentiment. Mr. Kittle stood awhile&lt;br /&gt;
aghast, like a person just waked from&lt;br /&gt;
a frightful dream; but on seeing the&lt;br /&gt;
Indian advancing to tear the scalp&lt;br /&gt;
from his dying brother, he suddenly&lt;br /&gt;
recollected himself, and shot a bullet&lt;br /&gt;
through his head. Then grappling&lt;br /&gt;
with the other, who was loading&lt;br /&gt;
again, he wrestled his firelock from&lt;br /&gt;
him, and felled him to the ground&lt;br /&gt;
with the butt end of it. This was&lt;br /&gt;
no time for reflection, or unavailing&lt;br /&gt;
laments; the danger was eminent!&lt;br /&gt;
So leaving the savages for dead, with&lt;br /&gt;
a mournful silence Mr. Kittle hasten-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to throw the deer from off his&lt;br /&gt;
horse, and laid his bleeding brother&lt;br /&gt;
across him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When our souls are gloomy, they&lt;br /&gt;
seem to cast a shade over the objects&lt;br /&gt;
that surround us, and make nature&lt;br /&gt;
correspondent to our feelings: so Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Kittle thought the night fell with a&lt;br /&gt;
deeper gloom than usual. The soft&lt;br /&gt;
notes of evening birds seemed to be&lt;br /&gt;
the responses of savage yells. The&lt;br /&gt;
echo of his tread, which he never&lt;br /&gt;
before regarded, now rung dismally&lt;br /&gt;
hollow in his ears. Even the rust-&lt;br /&gt;
ling of the winds through the leaves&lt;br /&gt;
seemed attended with a solemnity&lt;br /&gt;
that chilled him with cold tremors.&lt;br /&gt;
As he proceeded with his mournful&lt;br /&gt;
charge, his feelings were alarmed for&lt;br /&gt;
his dear Maria; he dreaded the agi-&lt;br /&gt;
tation and distress this adventure&lt;br /&gt;
would throw her in–but it was un-&lt;br /&gt;
avoidable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sound of his horse’s feet no&lt;br /&gt;
sooner invaded the ears of Maria,&lt;br /&gt;
than seizing a light, she sprung with&lt;br /&gt;
a joyful impatience to the door, and&lt;br /&gt;
was met by her partner pale and&lt;br /&gt;
bloody, who endeavoured to prevent&lt;br /&gt;
too sudden a discovery of this cala-&lt;br /&gt;
mity. But at the first glance she&lt;br /&gt;
comprehended the whole affair, and&lt;br /&gt;
retiring a few steps, with the most&lt;br /&gt;
exquisite agony in her countenance,&lt;br /&gt;
“oh! Mr. Kittle,” she cried, clasping&lt;br /&gt;
her hands together, “it is all over–&lt;br /&gt;
we are betrayed–your brother is kil-&lt;br /&gt;
led!”–“Too true, oh! too fatally&lt;br /&gt;
true,” replied he, falling on his knees&lt;br /&gt;
beside her as she sunk down,” “my&lt;br /&gt;
angel! the very savages that solemnly&lt;br /&gt;
engaged to protect us have deprived&lt;br /&gt;
him of life; but I am yet alive, my&lt;br /&gt;
Maria, be comforted–I will instant-&lt;br /&gt;
ly procure carriages, and before morn-&lt;br /&gt;
ing you and your innocents shall be&lt;br /&gt;
beyond the reach of their malevo-&lt;br /&gt;
lence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By this time the family had croud-&lt;br /&gt;
ed about them, and with grievous&lt;br /&gt;
wailings were enquiring the particu-&lt;br /&gt;
lars of this sad adventure. Mr. Kit-&lt;br /&gt;
tle having related every circumstance&lt;br /&gt;
with brevity, ordered the corpse to&lt;br /&gt;
be laid in a remote chamber, desiring&lt;br /&gt;
at the same time a horse to be saddled&lt;br /&gt;
for him. Then, more oppressed by&lt;br /&gt;
his wife’s griefs than his own, he led&lt;br /&gt;
the disconsolate fair to her chamber,&lt;br /&gt;
where, being seated, she sighing de-&lt;br /&gt;
manded where he intended to go at&lt;br /&gt;
that time of night. “Only,” said&lt;br /&gt;
he, “to the village of Schochticook&lt;br /&gt;
to hire a couple of waggons; I shall&lt;br /&gt;
return in an hour I hope, with a pro-&lt;br /&gt;
per guard to secure our retreat from&lt;br /&gt;
this hostile place.” Maria was silent;&lt;br /&gt;
at length she burst into a flood of tears,&lt;br /&gt;
which his endearments only aug-&lt;br /&gt;
mented. Then expostulating with&lt;br /&gt;
him, “is it not enough,” cried she,&lt;br /&gt;
“that you have escaped one danger,&lt;br /&gt;
but must you be so very eager to en-&lt;br /&gt;
counter others? besides, you are spent&lt;br /&gt;
with sorrow and fatigue–let one of&lt;br /&gt;
your brothers perform this silent ex-&lt;br /&gt;
pedition.–“It is impossible,” re-&lt;br /&gt;
plied the tender husband; “how can&lt;br /&gt;
I dare to propose a danger to them&lt;br /&gt;
from which I would shrink myself?&lt;br /&gt;
their lives are equally precious with&lt;br /&gt;
mine–but God may disappoint our&lt;br /&gt;
fears, my love.” He would have&lt;br /&gt;
continued, but his spouse, rising from&lt;br /&gt;
her seat, interrupted him–“At least,&lt;br /&gt;
my dear, before you leave us give&lt;br /&gt;
your lovely babes a farewell embrace,&lt;br /&gt;
that if fate should–should–separate&lt;br /&gt;
us, that yet shall sweeten our hours&lt;br /&gt;
of absence.” Here she found her-&lt;br /&gt;
self clasped in her consort’s arms, who&lt;br /&gt;
exclaimed, “my Maria! I love you&lt;br /&gt;
passionately, and if the least shadow&lt;br /&gt;
of danger did appear to attend this&lt;br /&gt;
night’s travel, for your sake, for my&lt;br /&gt;
blessed children’s sake I would decline&lt;br /&gt;
it–but I have left the Indians life-&lt;br /&gt;
less, who, no doubt, attacked us from&lt;br /&gt;
some private pique–nor will they&lt;br /&gt;
be discovered until morning.”–&lt;br /&gt;
“Well then,” Maria answered, “I&lt;br /&gt;
no longer oppose you; forgive my&lt;br /&gt;
fears.” Mean while as she stept&lt;br /&gt;
to the cradle for her suckling, the fair&lt;br /&gt;
Anna, who was listening at the door,&lt;br /&gt;
anxious to hear her parents’ senti-&lt;br /&gt;
ments on this occasion, quitted her&lt;br /&gt;
station, and flew to them swift as&lt;br /&gt;
light, dropping on her knees before&lt;br /&gt;
her father, and looked up in his face&lt;br /&gt;
with the most attractive graces, and&lt;br /&gt;
the persuasive eloquence of simplicity.&lt;br /&gt;
Her neck and features were elegantly&lt;br /&gt;
turned, her complexion fairer than&lt;br /&gt;
the tuberose, and contrasted by the&lt;br /&gt;
most shining ringlets of dark hair.&lt;br /&gt;
Her eyes, whose brilliancy were sof-&lt;br /&gt;
tened through the medium of tears,&lt;br /&gt;
for a while dwelt tenderly on his&lt;br /&gt;
countenance. At length, with a&lt;br /&gt;
voice scarce audible, she sighed out,&lt;br /&gt;
“oh, Papa! do not leave us; if any&lt;br /&gt;
accident should happen to you,&lt;br /&gt;
Mamma will die of grief, and what&lt;br /&gt;
will become of poor Anna and Billy?&lt;br /&gt;
who will care for me? Who will teach&lt;br /&gt;
me when my Papa, my Mamma’s&lt;br /&gt;
Papa is gone?”–“My sweet child,”&lt;br /&gt;
replied he, embracing her and hold-&lt;br /&gt;
ing her to his bosom, “there is no&lt;br /&gt;
danger; I shall return in an hour,&lt;br /&gt;
and before to-morrow you shall be&lt;br /&gt;
safe on the plains of Albany, and my&lt;br /&gt;
heart shall exult over the happiness of&lt;br /&gt;
my family.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Kittle now approached with&lt;br /&gt;
her playful infant in her arms; but its&lt;br /&gt;
winning actions extorted nothing but&lt;br /&gt;
groans from her pained bosom, which&lt;br /&gt;
was more stormy than Ontario Lake,&lt;br /&gt;
when agitated by fierce winds. Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Kittle perceiving this uncommon e-&lt;br /&gt;
motion, gently took the child from&lt;br /&gt;
her, and repeatedly kissed it, while&lt;br /&gt;
new smiles dimpled its lovely aspect.&lt;br /&gt;
“Oh!” said he to himself, “this&lt;br /&gt;
gloom that darkens Maria’s soul is&lt;br /&gt;
supernatural!–it seems dreadfully&lt;br /&gt;
portentious!–Shall I yet stay?” But&lt;br /&gt;
here a servant informing him that his&lt;br /&gt;
horse was ready, he blushed at his&lt;br /&gt;
want of fortitude; and having con-&lt;br /&gt;
quered his irresolution, after the most&lt;br /&gt;
affecting and solemn parting, he quit-&lt;br /&gt;
ted his house, never to review it&lt;br /&gt;
more!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(To be continued.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2. October 1790]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maria then walked sadly back&lt;br /&gt;
again, and having assembled&lt;br /&gt;
the family in a little hall, they closed&lt;br /&gt;
and barred the doors. Mrs. Cornelia&lt;br /&gt;
Kittle, Maria’s sister-in-law, was far&lt;br /&gt;
advanced in her pregnancy, which&lt;br /&gt;
increased her husband’s uneasiness for&lt;br /&gt;
her; and they were debating in what&lt;br /&gt;
manner to accommodate her at Al-&lt;br /&gt;
bany, when the trampling of feet&lt;br /&gt;
about the house, and a yell of com-&lt;br /&gt;
plicated voices, announced the Indi-&lt;br /&gt;
ans’ arrival. Struck with horror and&lt;br /&gt;
consternation, the little family croud-&lt;br /&gt;
ed together in the center of the hall,&lt;br /&gt;
while the servants, at this alarm, be-&lt;br /&gt;
ing in a kitchen distant from the&lt;br /&gt;
house, saved themselves by a precipi-&lt;br /&gt;
tate flight. The little Billy, frighten-&lt;br /&gt;
ed at such dreadful sounds, clung fast&lt;br /&gt;
to his mother’s throbbing breast, while&lt;br /&gt;
Anna, in a silent agony of amaze-&lt;br /&gt;
ment, clasped her trembling knees.&lt;br /&gt;
The echo of their yells yet rung in&lt;br /&gt;
long vibrations through the forest,&lt;br /&gt;
when, with a thundering peal of&lt;br /&gt;
strokes at the door, they demanded&lt;br /&gt;
entrance. Distraction and despair&lt;br /&gt;
sat upon every face. Maria and her&lt;br /&gt;
companions gazed wildly at each o-&lt;br /&gt;
ther, till upon repeated menaces, and&lt;br /&gt;
efforts to break open the door, Co-&lt;br /&gt;
rnelia’s husband giving all for lost, lei-&lt;br /&gt;
surely advanced to the door. Corne-&lt;br /&gt;
lia seeing this, uttered a great shriek,&lt;br /&gt;
and cried out, “oh God! what are&lt;br /&gt;
you doing, my rash, rash, unfortu-&lt;br /&gt;
nate husband? you will be sacrificed.”&lt;br /&gt;
Then falling on her knees, she caught&lt;br /&gt;
hold of his hand, and sobbed out,&lt;br /&gt;
“oh! pity me, have mercy on your-&lt;br /&gt;
self, on me, on my child!”–“Alas!&lt;br /&gt;
my love,” said he, half turning, with&lt;br /&gt;
a look of distraction, “what can we&lt;br /&gt;
do? let us be resigned to the will of&lt;br /&gt;
God!” So saying, he unbarred the&lt;br /&gt;
door, and that instant received a fatal&lt;br /&gt;
bullet in his bosom, and fell back-&lt;br /&gt;
ward writhing in the agonies of death;&lt;br /&gt;
the rest recoiled at this horrible spec-&lt;br /&gt;
tacle, and huddled in a corner, send-&lt;br /&gt;
ing forth the most piercing cries; in&lt;br /&gt;
the interim the savages rushing in&lt;br /&gt;
with great shouts, proceeded to man-&lt;br /&gt;
gle the corpse, and having made an&lt;br /&gt;
incision round his head with a crook-&lt;br /&gt;
ed knife, they tugged off his bloody&lt;br /&gt;
scalp with barbarous triumph. While&lt;br /&gt;
this was perpetrating, an Indian, he-&lt;br /&gt;
deously painted, strode ferociously up&lt;br /&gt;
to Cornelia, (who sunk away at the&lt;br /&gt;
sight, and fainted on a chair) and clift&lt;br /&gt;
her white forehead deeply with his&lt;br /&gt;
tomahack. Her fine azure eyes just&lt;br /&gt;
opened, and then suddenly closing&lt;br /&gt;
forever, she tumbled lifeless at his&lt;br /&gt;
feet. His sanguinary soul was not&lt;br /&gt;
yet satisfied with blood; he deform-&lt;br /&gt;
ed her lovely body with deep gashes,&lt;br /&gt;
and tearing her unborn babe away,&lt;br /&gt;
dashed it to pieces against the stone&lt;br /&gt;
wall, with many additional circum-&lt;br /&gt;
stances of infernal cruelty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this horrid carnage, the&lt;br /&gt;
dead were stripped, and dragged from&lt;br /&gt;
the house, when one of the hellish&lt;br /&gt;
band advanced to Maria, who cir-&lt;br /&gt;
cling her babes with her white arms,&lt;br /&gt;
was sending hopeless petitions to Hea-&lt;br /&gt;
ven, and bemoaning their cruelly&lt;br /&gt;
lost situation–as he approached, ex-&lt;br /&gt;
pecting the fatal stroke, she endea-&lt;br /&gt;
voured to guard her children, and&lt;br /&gt;
with supplicating looks, implored for&lt;br /&gt;
mercy. The savage attempted not to&lt;br /&gt;
strike; but the astonishing Anna shel-&lt;br /&gt;
tered herself behind her Mamma,&lt;br /&gt;
while her blooming suckling quitting&lt;br /&gt;
her breast, gazed with a pleasing&lt;br /&gt;
wonder on the painted stranger.–&lt;br /&gt;
Maria soon recognized her old friend&lt;br /&gt;
that presented her with the belt, thro’&lt;br /&gt;
the loads of shells and feathers that&lt;br /&gt;
disguised him. This was no time,&lt;br /&gt;
however, to irritate him, by remind-&lt;br /&gt;
ing him of his promise; yet, guess-&lt;br /&gt;
ing her thoughts, he anticipated her&lt;br /&gt;
remonstrance. “Maria,” said he,&lt;br /&gt;
“be not afraid, I have promised to&lt;br /&gt;
protect you–you shall live and dance&lt;br /&gt;
with us around the fire at Canada;&lt;br /&gt;
but you have one small incumbrance,&lt;br /&gt;
which, if not removed, will much&lt;br /&gt;
impede your progress thither;” so say-&lt;br /&gt;
ing he seized her laughing babe by&lt;br /&gt;
the wrists, and forcibly endeavoured&lt;br /&gt;
to draw him from her arms. At this,&lt;br /&gt;
terrified beyond conception, she ex-&lt;br /&gt;
claimed, “oh God! leave me–leave&lt;br /&gt;
me my child! he shall not go, though&lt;br /&gt;
a legion of devils should try to se-&lt;br /&gt;
parate us!” holding him still fast,&lt;br /&gt;
while the Indian applied his strength&lt;br /&gt;
to tear him away, gnashing his teeth&lt;br /&gt;
at her opposition, “help! God of&lt;br /&gt;
Heaven!” screamed she, “help!&lt;br /&gt;
have pity–have mercy on this infant!&lt;br /&gt;
Oh God! oh Christ! can you bear&lt;br /&gt;
to see this? O mercy! mercy!&lt;br /&gt;
mercy! let a little spark of compass-&lt;br /&gt;
sion save this inoffending–this love-&lt;br /&gt;
ly angel!” By this time the breath-&lt;br /&gt;
less babe dropt its head on its bosom;&lt;br /&gt;
the wrists were nigh pinched off, and&lt;br /&gt;
seeing him just expiring, with a&lt;br /&gt;
dreadful shriek she resigned him to&lt;br /&gt;
the merciless hands of the savage,&lt;br /&gt;
who instantly dashed his little fore-&lt;br /&gt;
head against the stones, and casting&lt;br /&gt;
his bleeding body at some distance&lt;br /&gt;
from the house, left him to make his&lt;br /&gt;
exit in feeble and unheard groans.–&lt;br /&gt;
Then indeed, in the unutterable an-&lt;br /&gt;
guish of her soul, she fell prostrate,&lt;br /&gt;
and rending away her hair, she roar-&lt;br /&gt;
ed out her sorrows with a voice louder&lt;br /&gt;
than natural, and rendered awfully&lt;br /&gt;
hollow by too great an exertion.&lt;br /&gt;
“Oh, barbarians!” she exclaimed,&lt;br /&gt;
“surpassing devils in wickedness, so&lt;br /&gt;
may a tenfold night of misery enwrap&lt;br /&gt;
your black souls, as you have depri-&lt;br /&gt;
ved the babe of my bosom, the com-&lt;br /&gt;
fort of my cares–my blessed cherub&lt;br /&gt;
of light and life–Oh hell! are not&lt;br /&gt;
thy flames impatient to cleave the&lt;br /&gt;
center and engulph these wretches in&lt;br /&gt;
thy ever burning waves? are there no&lt;br /&gt;
thunders in Heaven–no avenging&lt;br /&gt;
Angel–no God, to take notice of&lt;br /&gt;
such Heaven-defying cruelties?”–&lt;br /&gt;
Then rushing to her dead infant with&lt;br /&gt;
redoubled cries, and clapping her&lt;br /&gt;
hands, she laid herself over his man-&lt;br /&gt;
gled body–again softened in tears&lt;br /&gt;
and moans, she wiped the blood from&lt;br /&gt;
his ghastly countenance, and prest&lt;br /&gt;
him to her heaving bosom, alternately&lt;br /&gt;
caressing him and her trembling An-&lt;br /&gt;
na, who, clinging to her with bitter&lt;br /&gt;
wailings, and kissing her hands and&lt;br /&gt;
face, entreated her to implore the sa-&lt;br /&gt;
vages for mercy. “Do, my angel&lt;br /&gt;
Mamma,” she urged, “do beg them&lt;br /&gt;
yet to pity­-beg them yet to save you&lt;br /&gt;
for my poor, poor Papa’s sake!–&lt;br /&gt;
Alas! if we are all killed, his heart&lt;br /&gt;
will break!–Oh! they can’t be rocks&lt;br /&gt;
and stones!–Don’t cry Mamma,&lt;br /&gt;
they will spare us!” Thus the little&lt;br /&gt;
orator endeavoured to console her af-&lt;br /&gt;
flicted mother; but their melancho-&lt;br /&gt;
ly endearments were soon interrupted&lt;br /&gt;
by the relentless savages, who having&lt;br /&gt;
plundered the house of every valua-&lt;br /&gt;
ble thing that was portable, returned&lt;br /&gt;
to Maria, and rudely catching her&lt;br /&gt;
arm, commanded her to follow them;&lt;br /&gt;
but repulsing them with the boldness&lt;br /&gt;
of despair, “leave me, leave me,”&lt;br /&gt;
she said, “I cannot go–I never will&lt;br /&gt;
quit my murdered child! too cruel&lt;br /&gt;
in your mercies, you have given me&lt;br /&gt;
life only to prolong my miseries!”–&lt;br /&gt;
Mean while the lovely Anna, terri-&lt;br /&gt;
fied at the hostile appearance of the&lt;br /&gt;
enemy, left her Mamma (struggling&lt;br /&gt;
to disengage herself from the Indians)&lt;br /&gt;
and fled precipitately to the house.&lt;br /&gt;
She had already concealed herself in&lt;br /&gt;
a closet, when Mrs. Kittle pursuing&lt;br /&gt;
her, was intercepted by flames, the&lt;br /&gt;
savages having fired the house. The&lt;br /&gt;
wretched child soon discovered her&lt;br /&gt;
deplorable situation, and almost suf-&lt;br /&gt;
focated by the smoke, with piercing&lt;br /&gt;
cries called for help to her dear, dear&lt;br /&gt;
mother.–Alas! what could the un-&lt;br /&gt;
happy parent do? whole sheets of&lt;br /&gt;
flames rolled between them, while in&lt;br /&gt;
a phrenzy of grief, she screamed out,&lt;br /&gt;
“oh! my last treasure! my beloved&lt;br /&gt;
Anna! try to escape the devouring&lt;br /&gt;
fire–come to me my sweet child–&lt;br /&gt;
the Indians will not kill us–Oh! my&lt;br /&gt;
perishing babe! have pity on your&lt;br /&gt;
mother–do not leave me quite desti-&lt;br /&gt;
tute!” Then turning to the calm&lt;br /&gt;
villains who attended her, she cried,&lt;br /&gt;
“why do you not attempt to rescue&lt;br /&gt;
my sweet innocent? can your unfeel-&lt;br /&gt;
ing hearts not bear to leave me one–&lt;br /&gt;
a solitary single one?” Again calling&lt;br /&gt;
to her Anna, she received no answer,&lt;br /&gt;
which being a presumption of her&lt;br /&gt;
death, the Indiana obliged Maria and&lt;br /&gt;
her brother Henry to quit the house,&lt;br /&gt;
which they effected with some diffi-&lt;br /&gt;
culty, the glowing beams falling a-&lt;br /&gt;
round them, and thick volumes of&lt;br /&gt;
smoke obscuring their passage; the&lt;br /&gt;
flames now struck a long splendor&lt;br /&gt;
through the humid atmosphere, and&lt;br /&gt;
blushed to open the tragical scene on&lt;br /&gt;
the face of Heaven. They had scarce&lt;br /&gt;
advanced two hundred yards with&lt;br /&gt;
their reluctant captives, when the&lt;br /&gt;
flaming structure tumbled to the earth,&lt;br /&gt;
with a dreadful crash. Our travelers&lt;br /&gt;
by instinct turned their eyes to the&lt;br /&gt;
mournful blaze, and Maria bursting&lt;br /&gt;
afresh into grievous lamentations,&lt;br /&gt;
cried, “there, there my brother!&lt;br /&gt;
my children are wrapt in arching&lt;br /&gt;
sheets of flames, that used to be cir-&lt;br /&gt;
cled in my arms–they are entomb-&lt;br /&gt;
ed in ruins that breathed their slum-&lt;br /&gt;
bers on my bosom–yet, oh! their&lt;br /&gt;
spotless souls even now rise from this&lt;br /&gt;
chaos of blood and fire, and are plead-&lt;br /&gt;
ing our injured cause before our God,&lt;br /&gt;
my brother!” He replied only in&lt;br /&gt;
sighs and groans–he scarcely heard&lt;br /&gt;
her, horror had froze up the avenues&lt;br /&gt;
of his soul, and all amazed and trem-&lt;br /&gt;
bling, he followed his leaders like a&lt;br /&gt;
person in a troublesome dream.&lt;br /&gt;
The distant flames now cast a fain-&lt;br /&gt;
ter light, and the northern breeze&lt;br /&gt;
bent the columnes of smoke over the&lt;br /&gt;
south horizon. Sad and benighted&lt;br /&gt;
they wandered through almost impe-&lt;br /&gt;
netrable swamps, forded the broad&lt;br /&gt;
stream of Tomhanick, and the rapid&lt;br /&gt;
river of Hosack; they passed through&lt;br /&gt;
deserted settlements, where the yel-&lt;br /&gt;
ling of solitary dogs increased the&lt;br /&gt;
solemnity of midnight, nor halted&lt;br /&gt;
till the stars, emitting a feebler lustre,&lt;br /&gt;
presaged the approach of day. Maria,&lt;br /&gt;
overcome by sorrow and fatigue, im-&lt;br /&gt;
mediately sunk helpless at the foot of&lt;br /&gt;
a tree, while the savages (who were&lt;br /&gt;
six in number) kindled a fire, and&lt;br /&gt;
prepared their meal, (in a calabash)&lt;br /&gt;
which consisted only of some parched&lt;br /&gt;
maize pulverized and enriched with&lt;br /&gt;
the fat of bears flesh. Observing&lt;br /&gt;
Maria had fallen asleep, they offered&lt;br /&gt;
not to disturb her, but invited Henry&lt;br /&gt;
Kittle to partake of their repast. He&lt;br /&gt;
durst not refuse them, and having&lt;br /&gt;
swallowed a few mouthfuls of their&lt;br /&gt;
unpalatable food, and accepted of a&lt;br /&gt;
pipe of tobacco, he desired leave to&lt;br /&gt;
repose himself, which being readily&lt;br /&gt;
granted, they soon followed his ex-&lt;br /&gt;
ample, and sunk asleep, leaving two&lt;br /&gt;
centinels to guard against surprise,&lt;br /&gt;
which precaution they always make&lt;br /&gt;
use of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am sorry, dear Susan, to quit&lt;br /&gt;
Maria in this interesting part of her&lt;br /&gt;
history; but order requires that we&lt;br /&gt;
should now return to her spouse,&lt;br /&gt;
whom we left on his way through&lt;br /&gt;
the wood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The village of Schochticook is&lt;br /&gt;
situated on a circular plain, surround-&lt;br /&gt;
ed by high hills, rising in form of an&lt;br /&gt;
amphitheatre. Mr. Kittle had just&lt;br /&gt;
gained the verge when, chancing to&lt;br /&gt;
cast his eyes around, he perceived the&lt;br /&gt;
whole southern hemisphere suddenly&lt;br /&gt;
illuminated with a bright blaze;&lt;br /&gt;
however, being accustomed to the&lt;br /&gt;
forests being often fired to clear it&lt;br /&gt;
from the under-wood, he was not&lt;br /&gt;
much surprised, but proceeded to&lt;br /&gt;
descend the hill. On his arriving&lt;br /&gt;
with the account of his brother’s&lt;br /&gt;
murder, the place was put in the&lt;br /&gt;
highest commotion–the men fitting&lt;br /&gt;
up their arms, and the women cla-&lt;br /&gt;
mouring about them, highly impor-&lt;br /&gt;
tunate to be removed to Albany; but&lt;br /&gt;
the night being very dark, this man-&lt;br /&gt;
oeuvre was deferred till morning;–&lt;br /&gt;
nor could Mr. Kittle prevail on a&lt;br /&gt;
single person to return with him dur-&lt;br /&gt;
ing the darkness–he felt himself&lt;br /&gt;
strangely agitated at this disappoint-&lt;br /&gt;
ment, and refusing to repose himself,&lt;br /&gt;
with great impatience he watched the&lt;br /&gt;
first orient beam of Phosphor, which&lt;br /&gt;
appearing, he sat off for home with&lt;br /&gt;
two waggons and a guard of three&lt;br /&gt;
Indians. As he approached his late&lt;br /&gt;
happy dwelling, his bosom dilated&lt;br /&gt;
with the pleasing hope of soon extra-&lt;br /&gt;
cating his beloved family from dan-&lt;br /&gt;
ger, he chid the slowness of the car-&lt;br /&gt;
riages, and felt impatient to dissipate&lt;br /&gt;
the apprehensions of Maria, to kiss&lt;br /&gt;
the pendant tear from her eye, and&lt;br /&gt;
press his sportive innocents to his bo-&lt;br /&gt;
som. While these bright ideas play-&lt;br /&gt;
ed round his soul, he lifted up his&lt;br /&gt;
eyes, and through an opening in the&lt;br /&gt;
woods beheld his farm–but what&lt;br /&gt;
language can express his surprise and&lt;br /&gt;
consternation at seeing his habitation&lt;br /&gt;
so suddenly desolated! a loud ex-&lt;br /&gt;
clamation of amaze burst from the&lt;br /&gt;
whole company at so unexpected a&lt;br /&gt;
view–the blood revolted from Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Kittle’s cheek–his heart throbbed&lt;br /&gt;
under the big emotion, and all aghast,&lt;br /&gt;
spurring on his horse, he entered the&lt;br /&gt;
enclosure with full speed.–Stop here&lt;br /&gt;
unhappy man! here let the fibres of&lt;br /&gt;
thy heart crack with excruciating mi-&lt;br /&gt;
sery–let the cruel view of mangled&lt;br /&gt;
wretches, so nearly allied to thee,&lt;br /&gt;
extort drops of blood from the cleav-&lt;br /&gt;
ing bosom!–It did–it did. Utter-&lt;br /&gt;
ing a deep groan he fell insensible&lt;br /&gt;
from his horse, while his attendants,&lt;br /&gt;
hastening towards him, were shocked&lt;br /&gt;
beyond conception at the dismal spec-&lt;br /&gt;
tacle, and starting back with averted&lt;br /&gt;
eyes from the dead, were thunderstruck,&lt;br /&gt;
not having power to move or speak.&lt;br /&gt;
After a while two Indians (who be-&lt;br /&gt;
ing used to sanguinary scenes, reco-&lt;br /&gt;
vered themselves first) took a blanket,&lt;br /&gt;
and walking backward to the man-&lt;br /&gt;
gled Cornelia, threw it over her nak-&lt;br /&gt;
ed body; the others then timidly ad-&lt;br /&gt;
vanced, and Mr. Kittle opening his&lt;br /&gt;
eyes, groaned again bitterly; then&lt;br /&gt;
raising himself on his knees, with a&lt;br /&gt;
look of unutterable anguish he called&lt;br /&gt;
upon his dear Maria. Alas! No&lt;br /&gt;
voice, but the solemn repetition of&lt;br /&gt;
his own cries were articulated to him:&lt;br /&gt;
then rising with an air of distraction,&lt;br /&gt;
he stalked round the bloody scene,&lt;br /&gt;
and examined the dead bodies, first&lt;br /&gt;
uncovering the pale visage of Corne-&lt;br /&gt;
lia, he surveyed in silence her dis-&lt;br /&gt;
torted features; but perceiving it was&lt;br /&gt;
not Maria, he gently laid the cloth&lt;br /&gt;
over again, and turning furiously,&lt;br /&gt;
caught up his ghastly infant, whose&lt;br /&gt;
little body was black with contusions,&lt;br /&gt;
and his skull horribly fractured. Al-&lt;br /&gt;
most fainting under his mournful&lt;br /&gt;
load, and staggering at the dreadful&lt;br /&gt;
discovery, he deposited it again on&lt;br /&gt;
the bloody earth, and clapping his&lt;br /&gt;
hands together repeatedly with vio-&lt;br /&gt;
lence, oh hell! hell! he cried, you&lt;br /&gt;
cannot inflict torments so exquisite as&lt;br /&gt;
those I now suffer! how am I crush-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to the center! how deeply am I&lt;br /&gt;
degraded below the worms of the sod!&lt;br /&gt;
Oh! my children! my children!&lt;br /&gt;
where are you now? Oh! my wife!&lt;br /&gt;
my Maria! the beloved of my bo-&lt;br /&gt;
som, are you too fallen a sacrifice?&lt;br /&gt;
Why do I survive these miseries, my&lt;br /&gt;
God? how can mortality support&lt;br /&gt;
them? Burst–burst my shrinking&lt;br /&gt;
heart, and punish a wretch for not&lt;br /&gt;
having died in the defence of such&lt;br /&gt;
lovely and innocent beings! Oh!&lt;br /&gt;
why was I absent in this fatal hour?&lt;br /&gt;
why did not their groans vibrate on&lt;br /&gt;
my soul that I might have flown to&lt;br /&gt;
their aid? Thus wildly lamenting&lt;br /&gt;
and wandering among the smoaking&lt;br /&gt;
ruins, he picked up some of the cal-&lt;br /&gt;
cined bones of his once beautiful&lt;br /&gt;
Anna. At this sight despair shook&lt;br /&gt;
his soul afresh, new agonies convuls-&lt;br /&gt;
ed his features, and dropping the sad&lt;br /&gt;
evidence of his miseries, he extend-&lt;br /&gt;
ed his arms to Heaven, and roared&lt;br /&gt;
out–revenge, great God! revenge if&lt;br /&gt;
thou art just and kind as represented!&lt;br /&gt;
Oh! that I had the power of an&lt;br /&gt;
archangel to thunder eternal horrors&lt;br /&gt;
on the guilty wretches who have blast-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the bud of my happiness, who&lt;br /&gt;
have darkened the brightest eyes that&lt;br /&gt;
ever opened on the light!&lt;br /&gt;
The men here interfering, to con-&lt;br /&gt;
sole him observed, the bones were&lt;br /&gt;
probably those of his brother Peter;&lt;br /&gt;
but on finding his skeleton entire,&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Kittle insisted that it must have&lt;br /&gt;
been Maria and Anna, who having&lt;br /&gt;
hid themselves, had doubtless perish-&lt;br /&gt;
ed in the flames. Again, in the fu-&lt;br /&gt;
rious extravagance of passion, he tore&lt;br /&gt;
the hair from his head, and casting&lt;br /&gt;
himself prostrate on the ashes, he ga-&lt;br /&gt;
thered the crumbling bones to his&lt;br /&gt;
bosom, while the big drops of an-&lt;br /&gt;
guish issued at every pore, till life,&lt;br /&gt;
unable longer to sustain the mental&lt;br /&gt;
conflict, suspended her powers, and&lt;br /&gt;
once more deprived him of sensation.&lt;br /&gt;
His companions having laid him on&lt;br /&gt;
a wagon, now conferred together&lt;br /&gt;
in what manner to proceed, and ap-&lt;br /&gt;
prehending an attack from the sava-&lt;br /&gt;
ges, they unanimously concluded to&lt;br /&gt;
lay the dead bodies on the remaining&lt;br /&gt;
carriage, and make the best of their&lt;br /&gt;
way to Schochticook, which they&lt;br /&gt;
accordingly performed with great&lt;br /&gt;
silence and expedition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may judge, my dear, what a&lt;br /&gt;
panic the appearance of this mourn-&lt;br /&gt;
ful cavalcade struck over the inhabit-&lt;br /&gt;
ants of this defenseless village. Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Kittle was gently laid on a bed, and&lt;br /&gt;
being let blood, his respiration be-&lt;br /&gt;
came less obstructed, though he con-&lt;br /&gt;
tinued senseless till his unfortunate&lt;br /&gt;
family were interred.–Six weeks&lt;br /&gt;
elapsed before he recovered any de-&lt;br /&gt;
gree of strength; but even then he&lt;br /&gt;
appeared pale and emaciated, like a&lt;br /&gt;
second Lazarus; his disposition was&lt;br /&gt;
entirely changed, his looks were&lt;br /&gt;
fierce, his attitudes wild and extra-&lt;br /&gt;
vagant, and his conversation, which&lt;br /&gt;
formerly was sensible, commanding&lt;br /&gt;
attention by a musical voice, now&lt;br /&gt;
was incoherent, and his cadence deep&lt;br /&gt;
and hollow, rather inspiring terror&lt;br /&gt;
than any pleasing sensation. Thirst-&lt;br /&gt;
ing for revenge, and perceiving that&lt;br /&gt;
solitude only tended to corrode his&lt;br /&gt;
moments with the blackest melancho-&lt;br /&gt;
ly, he soon after entered the British&lt;br /&gt;
service in the capacity of gentleman&lt;br /&gt;
volunteer, and signalized himself by&lt;br /&gt;
his prudence and intrepidity, attract-&lt;br /&gt;
ing the particular notice of his officers,&lt;br /&gt;
who being affection with his misfor-&lt;br /&gt;
tones, proffered their services to him&lt;br /&gt;
with so much friendship and candour,&lt;br /&gt;
as obliged him to accept of them, and&lt;br /&gt;
yet lightened the obligation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(To be continued.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3. November 1790]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But doubtless, my dear, your&lt;br /&gt;
generous sensibility is alarmed&lt;br /&gt;
at my silence about Mrs. Kittle; I&lt;br /&gt;
think we left her reposing under a&lt;br /&gt;
tree–she was the first that awaked&lt;br /&gt;
as the sun began to exhale the crystal&lt;br /&gt;
globules of morning, when half ris-&lt;br /&gt;
ing, and reclining on her elbow, she&lt;br /&gt;
surveyed the lovely landscape around&lt;br /&gt;
her with a deep sigh; they were on&lt;br /&gt;
an eminence that commanded an un-&lt;br /&gt;
limited prospect of the country every&lt;br /&gt;
way. The birds were cheerful; the&lt;br /&gt;
deer bounded fearless over the hills;&lt;br /&gt;
the meadows blushed with the ena-&lt;br /&gt;
mel of Flora; but grief had sadden-&lt;br /&gt;
ed every object in her sight–the&lt;br /&gt;
whole creation seemed a dark blank&lt;br /&gt;
to the fair mourner. Again recol-&lt;br /&gt;
lection unlocked the sluices of her&lt;br /&gt;
eyes, and her soft complaints disturb-&lt;br /&gt;
ed her savage companions, who, ris-&lt;br /&gt;
ing and kindling up the dying em-&lt;br /&gt;
bers, began to prepare their victuals,&lt;br /&gt;
which they invited her to partake of.&lt;br /&gt;
This she declined with visible de-&lt;br /&gt;
testation; and turning to her bro-&lt;br /&gt;
ther, with the dignity of conscious&lt;br /&gt;
merit in distress, “No,” said she,&lt;br /&gt;
“I never will receive a morsel from&lt;br /&gt;
those bloody hands yet dropping with&lt;br /&gt;
recent murder!–let me perish–let&lt;br /&gt;
the iron hand of famine first pinch&lt;br /&gt;
out my vitals and send me after my&lt;br /&gt;
children!” Notwithstanding this,&lt;br /&gt;
Henry added his solicitations that&lt;br /&gt;
she should accept of some refresh-&lt;br /&gt;
ment, reminding her of the conse-&lt;br /&gt;
quence of her fatal resolution, which&lt;br /&gt;
could be deemed no otherwise than&lt;br /&gt;
suicide. Finding this had no effect,&lt;br /&gt;
he tried to touch her feelings on a&lt;br /&gt;
softer key–“Remember, Maria,”&lt;br /&gt;
said he, “you have a tender husband&lt;br /&gt;
yet living; would you wish to deprive&lt;br /&gt;
him of every earthly consolation?&lt;br /&gt;
Would you add affliction to affliction,&lt;br /&gt;
and after he has performed the sor-&lt;br /&gt;
rowful obsequies of his children, to&lt;br /&gt;
crush all his remaining hope by the&lt;br /&gt;
news of your voluntary death? No,&lt;br /&gt;
live my sister! be assured he will soon&lt;br /&gt;
get us exchanged, when soft sympa-&lt;br /&gt;
thies shall wash away your sorrows,&lt;br /&gt;
and after a few years, who knows&lt;br /&gt;
but the smiles of a new lovely pro-&lt;br /&gt;
geny may again dawn a paradise of&lt;br /&gt;
happiness on you.” Maria was af-&lt;br /&gt;
fected, and half raising her eyes from&lt;br /&gt;
the earth, she replied, “Oh, my bro-&lt;br /&gt;
ther! How consoling do your words&lt;br /&gt;
sink on my heart! Though my reason&lt;br /&gt;
tells me your arguments are impro-&lt;br /&gt;
bable and fallacious, yet it soothes&lt;br /&gt;
the tempest of my soul–I will try&lt;br /&gt;
to live–perhaps I may again behold&lt;br /&gt;
my dear–dear–dear–husband!”&lt;br /&gt;
Here a flood of tears interrupted her.&lt;br /&gt;
As this conversation was held in&lt;br /&gt;
English, the savages were inquisitive&lt;br /&gt;
to know the subject of it, at the same&lt;br /&gt;
time enjoining them both never to&lt;br /&gt;
utter a syllable in the presence except&lt;br /&gt;
in their own uncouth dialect, which,&lt;br /&gt;
as they perfectly understood, they&lt;br /&gt;
could not excuse themselves from.&lt;br /&gt;
Henry then informed them that his&lt;br /&gt;
sister, objecting to their method of&lt;br /&gt;
preparing food, had desired him to&lt;br /&gt;
prevail with them to indulge her in&lt;br /&gt;
dressing her meals herself. This they&lt;br /&gt;
readily granted, and farther to ingra-&lt;br /&gt;
tiate themselves in the prisoners’ fa-&lt;br /&gt;
vour, they dispatched a young Indi-&lt;br /&gt;
an to hunt for partridges or quails&lt;br /&gt;
in the groves adjoining them: He&lt;br /&gt;
instantly returned with a brood of&lt;br /&gt;
wood-pigeons, scarcely fledged,&lt;br /&gt;
which he presented to Henry, who&lt;br /&gt;
cleaned and broiled them on sticks,&lt;br /&gt;
with an officious solicitude to please&lt;br /&gt;
his sister, which she observed with a&lt;br /&gt;
look of gratitude, and taking a pi-&lt;br /&gt;
geon from the stick, began to eat&lt;br /&gt;
more from complaisance than incli-&lt;br /&gt;
nation. Henry was delighted at her&lt;br /&gt;
ready acquiescence, and their repast&lt;br /&gt;
being ended, they proceeded on their&lt;br /&gt;
tiresome journey with less repining&lt;br /&gt;
than the preceding night. Maria&lt;br /&gt;
was exempted from carrying a bur-&lt;br /&gt;
den, yet she found the fatigue almost&lt;br /&gt;
intolerable. They continually passed&lt;br /&gt;
through a scene of conflagration, the&lt;br /&gt;
savages firing every cottage in their&lt;br /&gt;
way, whose mournful blaze catching&lt;br /&gt;
the dry fields of grain, would scorch&lt;br /&gt;
off hundred of acres in a few mo-&lt;br /&gt;
ments, and form a burning path for&lt;br /&gt;
their destroyers. As the sun ad-&lt;br /&gt;
vanced to his zenith, its rays beat&lt;br /&gt;
fiercely on our travelers, augmented&lt;br /&gt;
by the crackling flames around them;&lt;br /&gt;
when meeting with a cool stream of&lt;br /&gt;
water, Maria was commanded to sit&lt;br /&gt;
down (being overheated) while the&lt;br /&gt;
rest approached the rivulet; the In-&lt;br /&gt;
dian that guarded Maria was stoop-&lt;br /&gt;
ing down to drink, when a loud rust-&lt;br /&gt;
ling among the leaves, and trampling&lt;br /&gt;
of bushes attracted his attention; he&lt;br /&gt;
listened awhile seemingly much a-&lt;br /&gt;
larmed, then starting up suddenly, he&lt;br /&gt;
flew to Maria, and caught hold of&lt;br /&gt;
her hair, aiming his hatchet at her&lt;br /&gt;
head: the consequence was obvious,&lt;br /&gt;
and her fate seemed inevitable; yet,&lt;br /&gt;
with a stoical composure, she folded&lt;br /&gt;
her arms across, and waited the fatal&lt;br /&gt;
stroke with perfect resignation; but&lt;br /&gt;
while the weapon was yet suspended&lt;br /&gt;
over her, chancing to look around,&lt;br /&gt;
he perceived the noise to proceed from&lt;br /&gt;
a large deer, whose antlers were in-&lt;br /&gt;
tangled in the branches of a thicket.&lt;br /&gt;
Though an uncivilized inhabitant of&lt;br /&gt;
the forest, he blushed at his precipi-&lt;br /&gt;
tancy, and returning the instrument&lt;br /&gt;
of death to his girdle, after some he-&lt;br /&gt;
sitation made this apology: “Maria,&lt;br /&gt;
this sudden discovery is well for you;&lt;br /&gt;
I thought we had been pursued, and&lt;br /&gt;
we never suffer our prisoners to be re-&lt;br /&gt;
taken; however, I was imprudent to&lt;br /&gt;
attempt your life before there was a&lt;br /&gt;
probability of your being rescued:”&lt;br /&gt;
then desiring her to rise and drink,&lt;br /&gt;
he quickly shot the deer, his associ-&lt;br /&gt;
ates helping him to skin it. Instead&lt;br /&gt;
of quenching her thirst she sat down&lt;br /&gt;
pensive on the flowery margin, cast-&lt;br /&gt;
ing her eyes carelessly on the stream;&lt;br /&gt;
she knew not whether to esteem her&lt;br /&gt;
late deliverance from death a happy&lt;br /&gt;
providence or protraction of misery.&lt;br /&gt;
Observing the spotted trout, and other&lt;br /&gt;
fish, to dart sportively across the wa-&lt;br /&gt;
ter, she could not help exclaiming,&lt;br /&gt;
“Happy! happy animals! you have&lt;br /&gt;
not the fatal gift of reason to embitter&lt;br /&gt;
your pleasures; you cannot anticipate&lt;br /&gt;
your difficulties by apprehension, or&lt;br /&gt;
prolong them by recollection; inca-&lt;br /&gt;
pable of offending your Creator, the&lt;br /&gt;
blessings of your existence are secur-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to you: Alas! I envy the mean-&lt;br /&gt;
est among ye!” A gush of tears&lt;br /&gt;
concluded her soliloquy; and being&lt;br /&gt;
called to attend the company, she&lt;br /&gt;
arose, and they began their journey&lt;br /&gt;
for the afternoon. Henry desiring to&lt;br /&gt;
have a piece of venison (having left it&lt;br /&gt;
behind, seldom incommoding them-&lt;br /&gt;
selves with more than the hide and&lt;br /&gt;
tallow) they returned and obliged&lt;br /&gt;
him with a haunch, which was very&lt;br /&gt;
fat: at the next interval of travel he&lt;br /&gt;
dressed it for himself and Maria. In&lt;br /&gt;
the evening they crossed the river&lt;br /&gt;
somewhat below Fort-Edward, in a&lt;br /&gt;
canoe left hid under some bushes for&lt;br /&gt;
that purpose. They observed the&lt;br /&gt;
most profound silence until the en-&lt;br /&gt;
tered the woods again; but it was&lt;br /&gt;
very late before they halted, which&lt;br /&gt;
they did in a deep hollow, surround-&lt;br /&gt;
ed by pines whose tops seemed to be&lt;br /&gt;
lost in the clouds. It was necessary&lt;br /&gt;
here to light a fire, for the wolves&lt;br /&gt;
howled most dreadfully, and the&lt;br /&gt;
whole forest rung with the cries of&lt;br /&gt;
wild beasts of various sorts. The con-&lt;br /&gt;
fines of hell could not have given&lt;br /&gt;
Maria more dismal ideas than her&lt;br /&gt;
present situation; the horrid gloom of&lt;br /&gt;
the place, the scowling looks of her&lt;br /&gt;
murderous companions, the shrill&lt;br /&gt;
shrieks of owls, the loud cries of the&lt;br /&gt;
wolf, and mournful screams of pan-&lt;br /&gt;
thers, which were redoubled by dis-&lt;br /&gt;
tant echoes, as the terrible sounds&lt;br /&gt;
seemed dying away, shook her frame&lt;br /&gt;
with cold tremors: she sunk under&lt;br /&gt;
the oppression of terror, and almost&lt;br /&gt;
fainted in Henry’s arms: however,&lt;br /&gt;
on perceiving the beasts durst not ap-&lt;br /&gt;
proach the light, but began to retire,&lt;br /&gt;
she became a little more assured, and&lt;br /&gt;
helped Henry to erect a booth of pine&lt;br /&gt;
branches, making a bed of the same&lt;br /&gt;
materials in it while he prepared their&lt;br /&gt;
supper; having eaten, and kindled a&lt;br /&gt;
large fire in the front of her arbour,&lt;br /&gt;
she laid down and soon fell in a deep&lt;br /&gt;
sleep; she felt herself refreshed by&lt;br /&gt;
this unexpected repose, and the next&lt;br /&gt;
morning, with some alacrity, conti-&lt;br /&gt;
nued her journey, hoping at last to&lt;br /&gt;
arrive at some Christian settlement.&lt;br /&gt;
Arriving at Lake-Champlain, they&lt;br /&gt;
raised a wigwam on the bank, ex-&lt;br /&gt;
pecting the coming of Indians from&lt;br /&gt;
the opposite shore to carry them over.&lt;br /&gt;
Here our unfortunate captives were&lt;br /&gt;
stript of their habits, already rent to&lt;br /&gt;
pieces by briers, and attired each&lt;br /&gt;
with remnants of old blankets. In&lt;br /&gt;
this new distress Mrs. Kittle ventur-&lt;br /&gt;
ed to expostulate with the savages,&lt;br /&gt;
but it was talking to the stormy oce-&lt;br /&gt;
an; her complaints served only to di-&lt;br /&gt;
vert them; so retiring among the&lt;br /&gt;
bushes, she adjusted her coarse dress&lt;br /&gt;
somewhat decently, and then seating&lt;br /&gt;
herself silently under a spreading tree,&lt;br /&gt;
indulged herself in the luxury of sor-&lt;br /&gt;
row. Henry, sensible that they es-&lt;br /&gt;
pected more fortitude from him, and&lt;br /&gt;
that if he sunk under his adverse for-&lt;br /&gt;
tune, he should be worse treaded,&lt;br /&gt;
affected to be cheerful; he assisted&lt;br /&gt;
them in catching salmon, with which&lt;br /&gt;
the lake abounds; an incredible&lt;br /&gt;
quantity of wild fowl frequenting&lt;br /&gt;
the lake also, he laid snares for those&lt;br /&gt;
of the lesser sort, (not being allowed&lt;br /&gt;
fire-arms) and succeeded so well, that&lt;br /&gt;
his dexterity was highly commended,&lt;br /&gt;
and night coming on, they regaled&lt;br /&gt;
themselves on the fruits of their in-&lt;br /&gt;
dustry. The night was exceedingly&lt;br /&gt;
dark, but calm; a thick mist hovered&lt;br /&gt;
over the woods, and the small ridgy&lt;br /&gt;
waves softly rolled to the shore, when&lt;br /&gt;
suddenly a large meteor, or fiery ex-&lt;br /&gt;
halation, passed by them with sur-&lt;br /&gt;
prising velocity, casting on every side&lt;br /&gt;
showers of brilliant sparkles. At&lt;br /&gt;
sight of this phaenomenon, the Indians&lt;br /&gt;
put their heads between their knees,&lt;br /&gt;
crying out in a lamentable voice,&lt;br /&gt;
“Do not–do not–do not!” con-&lt;br /&gt;
tinuing in the same attitude until the&lt;br /&gt;
vapour disappeared. Henry, with&lt;br /&gt;
some surprise, demanded the reason&lt;br /&gt;
of this exclamation; to which they&lt;br /&gt;
replied, “What he had seen was a&lt;br /&gt;
fiery dragon, on his passage to his&lt;br /&gt;
den, who was of so malevolent a&lt;br /&gt;
temper, that he never failed, on his&lt;br /&gt;
arrival there, to inflict some peculiar&lt;br /&gt;
calamity on mankind.” In about&lt;br /&gt;
five minutes after the earth was vio-&lt;br /&gt;
lently agitated, the waves of the lake&lt;br /&gt;
tumbled about in a strange manner,&lt;br /&gt;
seeming to emit flashes of fire, all&lt;br /&gt;
the while attended with most tremen-&lt;br /&gt;
dous roarings, intermixed with loud&lt;br /&gt;
noises, not unlike the explosion of&lt;br /&gt;
heavy cannon. Soon as the Indians&lt;br /&gt;
perceived it was an earthquake, they&lt;br /&gt;
cried out, “Now he comes home!”&lt;br /&gt;
and casting themselves in their former&lt;br /&gt;
posture, filled the air with dismal&lt;br /&gt;
howlings. This was a terrible scene&lt;br /&gt;
to Maria, who had never been wit-&lt;br /&gt;
ness to so dreadful a convulsion of&lt;br /&gt;
nature before; she started up and fled&lt;br /&gt;
from her savage companions towards&lt;br /&gt;
an eminence at some distance, where&lt;br /&gt;
dropping on her knees, she empha-&lt;br /&gt;
tically implored the protection of&lt;br /&gt;
Heaven: however, she was followed&lt;br /&gt;
by an Indian and Henry; the latter&lt;br /&gt;
highly affected with her distresses,&lt;br /&gt;
taking hold of her trembling hand,&lt;br /&gt;
“But why, my sister!” said he&lt;br /&gt;
“have you fled from us? is the gloom&lt;br /&gt;
of a forest more chearing than the&lt;br /&gt;
sympathizing looks of a friend?”&lt;br /&gt;
“No, my brother!” replied Maria,&lt;br /&gt;
“but the thought was suggested to&lt;br /&gt;
me, that the supreme God perhaps&lt;br /&gt;
was preparing to avenge himself of&lt;br /&gt;
these murderers by some awful and&lt;br /&gt;
uncommon judgment, and I fled from&lt;br /&gt;
them as Lot did from Sodom, lest I&lt;br /&gt;
might be involved in the punishment&lt;br /&gt;
of their guilt.” They conversed in&lt;br /&gt;
English, which displeasing the Indi-&lt;br /&gt;
an, he ordered them to return to the&lt;br /&gt;
wigwam, threatening to bind Maria&lt;br /&gt;
fast if she offered to elope again. The&lt;br /&gt;
shock being over, silence again spread&lt;br /&gt;
through the realms of darkness, when&lt;br /&gt;
a high wind arose from the north and&lt;br /&gt;
chilled our half-naked travelers with&lt;br /&gt;
excessive cold. The savages, (whose&lt;br /&gt;
callous skins were proof against the&lt;br /&gt;
inclement weather) not caring to&lt;br /&gt;
continue their fires, lest they should&lt;br /&gt;
be discovered and surprised by some&lt;br /&gt;
English party, they passed here a&lt;br /&gt;
very uncomfortable night; but the&lt;br /&gt;
wind subsiding, and the sky growing&lt;br /&gt;
clear, the sun rose peculiarly warm&lt;br /&gt;
and pleasant, streaming ten thousand&lt;br /&gt;
rays of gold across the lake. Maria&lt;br /&gt;
had scarcely performed her oraisons,&lt;br /&gt;
when the savages, forming a circle&lt;br /&gt;
round her and Henry, began to dance&lt;br /&gt;
in a most extravagant manner, and&lt;br /&gt;
with antic gestures that at another&lt;br /&gt;
time would have afforded mirth to&lt;br /&gt;
our travelers. Having continued&lt;br /&gt;
their exercise some time, they incon-&lt;br /&gt;
tinently drew out boxes of paint,&lt;br /&gt;
and began to ornament their captives&lt;br /&gt;
with a variety of colours; one hav-&lt;br /&gt;
ing crossed their faces with a stroke&lt;br /&gt;
of vermillion, another would inter-&lt;br /&gt;
sect it with a line of black, and so&lt;br /&gt;
on until the whole company had&lt;br /&gt;
given a specimen of their skill or&lt;br /&gt;
fancy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after two canoes arrived, in&lt;br /&gt;
which they passed over the lake,&lt;br /&gt;
which was uncommonly serene and&lt;br /&gt;
pleasant. They proceeded not far&lt;br /&gt;
on their way before they were ob-&lt;br /&gt;
liged to halt for two days, on account&lt;br /&gt;
of Maria’s inability to travel, her&lt;br /&gt;
feet being greatly swollen and lace-&lt;br /&gt;
rated by the flinty path. At length,&lt;br /&gt;
by easy stages, they came in view of&lt;br /&gt;
an Indian settlement, when Maria’s&lt;br /&gt;
long unbent features relaxed into a&lt;br /&gt;
half smile, and turning to Henry,&lt;br /&gt;
“Here, my brother!” said she, “I&lt;br /&gt;
shall find some of my own sex, to&lt;br /&gt;
whom simple nature, no doubt, has&lt;br /&gt;
taught humanity; this is the first pre-&lt;br /&gt;
cept she inculcates in the female&lt;br /&gt;
mind, and this they generally retain&lt;br /&gt;
through life, in spite of every evil&lt;br /&gt;
propensity.” As she uttered this&lt;br /&gt;
elogium in favour of the fair, the&lt;br /&gt;
tawny villagers, perceiving their ap-&lt;br /&gt;
proach, rushed promiscuously from&lt;br /&gt;
their huts with a execrable din, and&lt;br /&gt;
fell upon the weary captives with&lt;br /&gt;
clubs and a shower of stones, accom-&lt;br /&gt;
panying their strokes with the most&lt;br /&gt;
virulent language; among the rest an&lt;br /&gt;
old deformed squaw, with the rage&lt;br /&gt;
of a Tisiphone, flew to Maria, aim-&lt;br /&gt;
ing a pine-knot at her head, and&lt;br /&gt;
would certainly have given the&lt;br /&gt;
wretched mourner her quietus had&lt;br /&gt;
she not been opposed by the savage&lt;br /&gt;
that guarded Mrs. Kittle: he at first&lt;br /&gt;
mildly expostulated with his passion-&lt;br /&gt;
ate countrywoman; but finding the&lt;br /&gt;
old hag frantic, and insatiable of&lt;br /&gt;
blood, he twisted the pine-know from&lt;br /&gt;
her hand, and whirled it away to&lt;br /&gt;
some distance, then seizing her arm&lt;br /&gt;
roughly, and tripping up her heels,&lt;br /&gt;
he laid her prostrate, leaving her to&lt;br /&gt;
howl and yell at leisure, which she&lt;br /&gt;
performed without a prompter.–&lt;br /&gt;
Maria was all in a tremor, and has-&lt;br /&gt;
tily followed her deliverer, not car-&lt;br /&gt;
ing to risk another encounter with&lt;br /&gt;
the exasperated virago. By this time&lt;br /&gt;
the rage and tumult of the savages&lt;br /&gt;
subsiding, the new-comers were ad-&lt;br /&gt;
mitted into a large wigwam, in the&lt;br /&gt;
center of which blazed a fire. After&lt;br /&gt;
they were seated, several young In-&lt;br /&gt;
dians entered with baskets of green&lt;br /&gt;
maize in the ear, which, having roast-&lt;br /&gt;
ed before the fire, they distributed&lt;br /&gt;
among the company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mrs. Kittle and her brother com-&lt;br /&gt;
plaining of the bruises they met with&lt;br /&gt;
at their reception, an old Indian&lt;br /&gt;
seemed to attend with great concern,&lt;br /&gt;
then leaving the place, in a little time&lt;br /&gt;
returned with a bundle of aromatic&lt;br /&gt;
herbs under his arm, the juice of&lt;br /&gt;
which, he expressed by rubbing them&lt;br /&gt;
between two stones with flat surfaces;&lt;br /&gt;
this he gave them to drink, applying&lt;br /&gt;
the leaves externally. They instant-&lt;br /&gt;
ly found relief from the medical qua-&lt;br /&gt;
lity of this extraordinary plant, and&lt;br /&gt;
composing themselves to sleep, ex-&lt;br /&gt;
pected a good night’s repose; but&lt;br /&gt;
they were mistaken, for their enter-&lt;br /&gt;
tainers growing intoxicated with spi-&lt;br /&gt;
rituous liquors, which operating dif-&lt;br /&gt;
ferently, it produced a most compli-&lt;br /&gt;
cated noise of yelling, talking, sing-&lt;br /&gt;
ing, and quarrelling: this was a&lt;br /&gt;
charm more powerful than the wand&lt;br /&gt;
of Hermes to drive away sleep; but&lt;br /&gt;
grown familiar with sorrow and dis-&lt;br /&gt;
appointment, Maria regarded this as&lt;br /&gt;
a trifle, and when Henry expressed&lt;br /&gt;
his concern for her, smiling, replied,&lt;br /&gt;
“We must arm ourselves with pati-&lt;br /&gt;
ence, my brother! we can combat&lt;br /&gt;
with fate in no other manner.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It were endless to recapitulate mi-&lt;br /&gt;
nutely every distress that attended the&lt;br /&gt;
prisoners in their tedious journey; let&lt;br /&gt;
it suffice, that having passed through&lt;br /&gt;
uncommon misery, and imminent&lt;br /&gt;
danger, they arrived at Montreal.&lt;br /&gt;
Here the savages were joined by seve-&lt;br /&gt;
ral scalping parties of their tribe, and&lt;br /&gt;
having previously fresh painted them-&lt;br /&gt;
selves, appeared in hideous pomp, and&lt;br /&gt;
performed a kind of triumphal entry.&lt;br /&gt;
The throng of people that came out&lt;br /&gt;
to meet them threw Maria in the most&lt;br /&gt;
painful sensations of embarrassment;&lt;br /&gt;
but as the clamours and insults of the&lt;br /&gt;
populace encreased, a freezing tor-&lt;br /&gt;
por succeeded, and bedewed her&lt;br /&gt;
limbs with a cold sweat–strange chi-&lt;br /&gt;
meras danced before her sight–the&lt;br /&gt;
actings of her soul were suspended&lt;br /&gt;
–she seemed to move mechanically,&lt;br /&gt;
nor recollected herself till she found&lt;br /&gt;
she was seated in the Governor’s hall,&lt;br /&gt;
surrounded by an impertinent, inqui-&lt;br /&gt;
sitive circle of people, who were en-&lt;br /&gt;
quiring into the cause of her disor-&lt;br /&gt;
der, without attempting any thing&lt;br /&gt;
towards her relief. Discovering her&lt;br /&gt;
situation, she blushingly withdrew to&lt;br /&gt;
a dark corner from the public gaze,&lt;br /&gt;
and could not help sighing to herself,&lt;br /&gt;
“Alas! but a very few days ago I&lt;br /&gt;
was hailed as the happiest of women&lt;br /&gt;
–my fond husband anticipated all&lt;br /&gt;
my desires–my children smiled&lt;br /&gt;
round me with filial delight–my&lt;br /&gt;
very servants paid me the homage&lt;br /&gt;
due to an angel–oh! my God!&lt;br /&gt;
what a sudden, what a deplorable&lt;br /&gt;
transition! I am fallen below con-&lt;br /&gt;
tempt.” As she thus moralized on&lt;br /&gt;
her situation, an English woman&lt;br /&gt;
(whom humanity more than curiosi-&lt;br /&gt;
ty had drawn to the place) approach-&lt;br /&gt;
ed Maria, and observing her tears and&lt;br /&gt;
deep dejection, took hold of her hand,&lt;br /&gt;
and endeavoured to smile, but the&lt;br /&gt;
soft impulses of nature were too strong&lt;br /&gt;
for the efforts of dissimulation–her&lt;br /&gt;
features instantly saddened again, and&lt;br /&gt;
she burst into tears, exclaiming, (with&lt;br /&gt;
a hesitating voice,) “Poor, forlorn&lt;br /&gt;
creature! where are thy friends!&lt;br /&gt;
perhaps the dying moments of thy&lt;br /&gt;
fond parent, or husband, have been&lt;br /&gt;
cruelly embittered with the sight of&lt;br /&gt;
thy captivity! perhaps now thy help-&lt;br /&gt;
less orphan is mourning for the breast&lt;br /&gt;
which gave him nourishment! or thy&lt;br /&gt;
plaintive little ones are wondering at&lt;br /&gt;
the long absence of their miserable&lt;br /&gt;
mother!”–“Oh! no more! no&lt;br /&gt;
more!” interrupted Maria, “your&lt;br /&gt;
pity is severer than savage cruelty–I&lt;br /&gt;
could stand the shock of fortune with&lt;br /&gt;
some degree of firmness, but your&lt;br /&gt;
soft sympathy opens afresh the wounds&lt;br /&gt;
of my soul! my losses are beyond&lt;br /&gt;
your conjecture–I have no parent!&lt;br /&gt;
no sportive children! and, I believe,&lt;br /&gt;
no husband! to mourn and wish for&lt;br /&gt;
me.” These words were succeeded&lt;br /&gt;
by an affecting silence on both sides:&lt;br /&gt;
mean while the Indians testified their&lt;br /&gt;
impatience to be admitted to the&lt;br /&gt;
Governor by frequent shouts; at&lt;br /&gt;
Length his Excellency appeared, and&lt;br /&gt;
Having held a long conference with&lt;br /&gt;
The savages, they retired with his Se-&lt;br /&gt;
cretary, and our prisoners saw them&lt;br /&gt;
no more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(To be continued.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[4. December 1790]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After their exit the Governor&lt;br /&gt;
Turning round to Maria and&lt;br /&gt;
Henry, demanded who they were?&lt;br /&gt;
Mrs. Kittle’s perplexity prevented&lt;br /&gt;
her reply; but Henry, in a most re-&lt;br /&gt;
spectful manner, gave him a succinct&lt;br /&gt;
account of their misfortunes. The&lt;br /&gt;
Governor perceiving him sensible and&lt;br /&gt;
communicative, interrogated him far-&lt;br /&gt;
ther, but he modestly declined giv-&lt;br /&gt;
ing any political intelligence. Ob-&lt;br /&gt;
serving that Maria suffered greatly in&lt;br /&gt;
this interview, he soon concluded it,&lt;br /&gt;
after having presented several pieces&lt;br /&gt;
of callicoes and stuffs to them, desir-&lt;br /&gt;
ing they would accept what they had&lt;br /&gt;
occasion for. Mrs. Kittle immedi-&lt;br /&gt;
ately singled out a piece of black cal-&lt;br /&gt;
limanco with tears of gratitude to&lt;br /&gt;
her benefactor; who, smiling, ob-&lt;br /&gt;
served she might chuse a gayer co-&lt;br /&gt;
lour, as he hoped her distresses were&lt;br /&gt;
now over. Maria shook her head in&lt;br /&gt;
token of dissent, but could make no&lt;br /&gt;
reply. He then dismissed them, with&lt;br /&gt;
a small guard, who was directed to&lt;br /&gt;
provide them with decent lodging.&lt;br /&gt;
Henry was accommodated at a&lt;br /&gt;
bakers, while his sister, to her no&lt;br /&gt;
small satisfaction, found herself plac-&lt;br /&gt;
ed at the English woman’s who, on&lt;br /&gt;
her arrival, had expressed so much&lt;br /&gt;
good nature.–She had scarcely en-&lt;br /&gt;
tered, when Mrs. D.–, presenting&lt;br /&gt;
her with a cordial, led her to a couch,&lt;br /&gt;
insisting on her reposing there a little,&lt;br /&gt;
“for,” says she, “your waste of&lt;br /&gt;
spirits requires it.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This tenderness, which Maria had&lt;br /&gt;
long been a stranger to, relaxed every&lt;br /&gt;
fibre of her heart: She again melted&lt;br /&gt;
into tears; but it was a gush of grate-&lt;br /&gt;
ful acknowledgment, that called a&lt;br /&gt;
modest blush of pleasure and per-&lt;br /&gt;
plexity on Mrs. D–‘s check. Be-&lt;br /&gt;
ing left alone, she soon fell in a pro-&lt;br /&gt;
found sleep; and her friend having&lt;br /&gt;
prepared a comfortable repast, in less&lt;br /&gt;
than an hour awaked her, with an&lt;br /&gt;
invitation to dinner–“and how do&lt;br /&gt;
you find yourself, my sister?” said&lt;br /&gt;
she instinctively, seizing Maria’s hand&lt;br /&gt;
and compressing it between hers;&lt;br /&gt;
“may we hope that you will assist&lt;br /&gt;
us in conquering your dejection?”–&lt;br /&gt;
Maria smiled benignly through a&lt;br /&gt;
chrystal atmosphere of tears, and kis-&lt;br /&gt;
sing the hand of her friend, arose.&lt;br /&gt;
Having dined, and being now equip-&lt;br /&gt;
ped in decent apparel, Maria became&lt;br /&gt;
the admiration and esteem of the&lt;br /&gt;
whole family. The tempest of her&lt;br /&gt;
soul subsided in a solemn calm; and&lt;br /&gt;
though she did not regain her viva-&lt;br /&gt;
city, she became agreeably convers-&lt;br /&gt;
able.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a few days, however, she felt&lt;br /&gt;
the symptoms of an approaching fe-&lt;br /&gt;
ver. She was alarmed at this, and&lt;br /&gt;
intimated to Mrs. D–her fears&lt;br /&gt;
of becoming troublesome. “Do not&lt;br /&gt;
be concerned,” returned that kind&lt;br /&gt;
creature; “my God did not plant&lt;br /&gt;
humanity in my breast to remain there&lt;br /&gt;
an inactive principle.” Maria felt&lt;br /&gt;
her oppression relieved by this gene-&lt;br /&gt;
rous sentiment; and indeed found her&lt;br /&gt;
friendship did not consist in profess-&lt;br /&gt;
sion, as she incessantly tended her&lt;br /&gt;
during her illness with inexpressible&lt;br /&gt;
delicacy and solicitude. When she&lt;br /&gt;
was again on the recovery, Mrs.&lt;br /&gt;
D–one day ordered a small truck&lt;br /&gt;
covered with Morocco leather to be&lt;br /&gt;
brought before her, and opening it,&lt;br /&gt;
produced several sets of fine linen,&lt;br /&gt;
with some elegant stuffs and other&lt;br /&gt;
necessaries–“See,” said she, “what&lt;br /&gt;
the benevolence of Montreal has done&lt;br /&gt;
for you. The ladies that beg your&lt;br /&gt;
acceptance of these things, intend&lt;br /&gt;
likewise to inhance the favour, by&lt;br /&gt;
waiting on you this afternoon.”–&lt;br /&gt;
“Ah!” interrupted Maria, “I want&lt;br /&gt;
Them not; this one plain habit is&lt;br /&gt;
enough to answer the purpose of&lt;br /&gt;
dress for me. Shut the chest my dear&lt;br /&gt;
Mrs. D–, and keep them as a&lt;br /&gt;
small compensation for the immense&lt;br /&gt;
trouble I have been to you.”–“If&lt;br /&gt;
this is your real sentiment,” replied&lt;br /&gt;
her friend, (shutting the chest, and&lt;br /&gt;
presenting her the key,) “return&lt;br /&gt;
your gifts to the donors; and since&lt;br /&gt;
you will reward me for my little of-&lt;br /&gt;
fices of friendship, only love me, and&lt;br /&gt;
believe me disinterested, and I shall&lt;br /&gt;
be overpaid.”–“I see I have wrong-&lt;br /&gt;
ed your generosity,” answered Maria.&lt;br /&gt;
“Pardon me, my sister, I will offend&lt;br /&gt;
no more. I did not think you mer-&lt;br /&gt;
cinary–but–but–I meant only to&lt;br /&gt;
disengage my heart of a little of its&lt;br /&gt;
burden.”–As this tender contest was&lt;br /&gt;
painful to both parties, Mrs. D–&lt;br /&gt;
rising abruptly, pretended some bu-&lt;br /&gt;
siness, promising to return again di-&lt;br /&gt;
rectly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the afternoon Maria received&lt;br /&gt;
her visitants in a neat little parlour.&lt;br /&gt;
She was dressed in a plain suit of&lt;br /&gt;
mourning, and wore a small muslin&lt;br /&gt;
cap, from which her hair fell in art-&lt;br /&gt;
less curls on her fine neck: her face&lt;br /&gt;
was pale, though not emaciated, and&lt;br /&gt;
her eyes streamed a soft languor over&lt;br /&gt;
her countenance, more bewitching&lt;br /&gt;
than the sprightliest glances of viva-&lt;br /&gt;
city. As they entered she arose, and&lt;br /&gt;
advancing, modestly received their&lt;br /&gt;
civilities, while Mrs. D–handed&lt;br /&gt;
them to chairs: But hearing a well-&lt;br /&gt;
known voice, she hastily lifted up her&lt;br /&gt;
eyes, and screamed out in an accent&lt;br /&gt;
of surprise, “Good Heaven! May&lt;br /&gt;
I credit my senses? My dear Mrs.&lt;br /&gt;
Bratt, my kind neighbor, is it re-&lt;br /&gt;
ally you that I see?” Here she found&lt;br /&gt;
herself clasped in her friend’s arms,&lt;br /&gt;
who, after a long subsiding sigh,&lt;br /&gt;
broke into tears. The tumult of pas-&lt;br /&gt;
sion at length abating–“Could I&lt;br /&gt;
have guessed, my Maria,” said she,&lt;br /&gt;
“that you was here, my visit should&lt;br /&gt;
not have been deferred a moment af-&lt;br /&gt;
ter your arrival; but I have mourn-&lt;br /&gt;
ed with a sister in affliction, (permit&lt;br /&gt;
me to present her to you,) and while&lt;br /&gt;
our hearts were wrung with each&lt;br /&gt;
other’s distress, alas! we enquired&lt;br /&gt;
after no foreign calamity.” Being&lt;br /&gt;
all seated, “I dare not,” resumed&lt;br /&gt;
Maria, “ask after your family; I&lt;br /&gt;
am afraid you only have escaped to&lt;br /&gt;
tell me of them.” Not so, my sister,”&lt;br /&gt;
cried Mrs. Bratt; “but if you can&lt;br /&gt;
bear the recollection of your misfor-&lt;br /&gt;
tunes, do oblige me with the recital.”&lt;br /&gt;
The ladies joined their entreaty, and&lt;br /&gt;
Mrs. Kittle complied in a graceful&lt;br /&gt;
manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After some time spent in tears,&lt;br /&gt;
and pleasing melancholy, tea was&lt;br /&gt;
brought in; and towards sun-set Mrs.&lt;br /&gt;
D–invited the company to walk&lt;br /&gt;
in the garden, which being very&lt;br /&gt;
small, consisted only of a parterre, at&lt;br /&gt;
the farther end of which stood an&lt;br /&gt;
arbour covered with a grape-vine.&lt;br /&gt;
Here being seated, after some chat&lt;br /&gt;
on indifferent subjects, Maria desired&lt;br /&gt;
Mrs. Bratt (if agreeable to the com-&lt;br /&gt;
pany) to acquaint her with the cir-&lt;br /&gt;
cumstances of her capture. They all&lt;br /&gt;
bowed approbation; and after some&lt;br /&gt;
hesitation Mrs. Bratt began:–&lt;br /&gt;
“My heart, ladies, shall ever re-&lt;br /&gt;
tain a sense of the happiness I enjoy-&lt;br /&gt;
ed in the society of Mrs. Kittle and&lt;br /&gt;
several other amiable persons in the&lt;br /&gt;
vicinage of Schochticook, where I&lt;br /&gt;
resided. She in particular cheered&lt;br /&gt;
my lonely hours of widowhood, and&lt;br /&gt;
omitted nothing that she thought&lt;br /&gt;
might conduce to my serenity. I had&lt;br /&gt;
two sons; she recommended the edu-&lt;br /&gt;
cation of them to my leisure hours.&lt;br /&gt;
I accepted of her advice, and found&lt;br /&gt;
a suspension of my sorrows in the&lt;br /&gt;
execution of my duty. They soon&lt;br /&gt;
improved beyond my capacity of&lt;br /&gt;
teaching. Richard, my eldest, was&lt;br /&gt;
passionately fond of books, which he&lt;br /&gt;
studied with intense application.&lt;br /&gt;
This naturally attached him to a se-&lt;br /&gt;
dentary life, and he became the con-&lt;br /&gt;
stant instructive companion of me&lt;br /&gt;
evening hours. My youngest son,&lt;br /&gt;
Charles, was more volatile, yet not&lt;br /&gt;
less agreeable; his person was charm-&lt;br /&gt;
ing, his wit sprightly, and his ad-&lt;br /&gt;
dress elegant. They often impor-&lt;br /&gt;
tuned me, at the commencement of&lt;br /&gt;
this war, to withdraw to Albany;&lt;br /&gt;
but as I apprehended no danger, (the&lt;br /&gt;
British troops being stationed above&lt;br /&gt;
us, quite from Saratoga to the Lake)&lt;br /&gt;
I ridiculed their fears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“One evening as my sons were&lt;br /&gt;
come in from reaping, and I was&lt;br /&gt;
busied in preparing them a dish of&lt;br /&gt;
tea, we were surprised by a discharge&lt;br /&gt;
of musketry near us. We all three&lt;br /&gt;
ran to the door, and beheld a party&lt;br /&gt;
of Indians not twenty paces from us.&lt;br /&gt;
Struck with astonishment, we had no&lt;br /&gt;
power to move, and the savages again&lt;br /&gt;
firing that instant, my Charles drop-&lt;br /&gt;
ped down dead beside me. Good&lt;br /&gt;
God! what were my emotions?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But language would fail, should I&lt;br /&gt;
attempt to describe them. My sur-&lt;br /&gt;
viving son then turning to me, with&lt;br /&gt;
a countenance expressive of the deep-&lt;br /&gt;
est horror urged me to fly. “Let&lt;br /&gt;
us begone this instant,” said he; “a&lt;br /&gt;
moment determines our fate. O!&lt;br /&gt;
my mother! you are already lost.”&lt;br /&gt;
But despair had swallowed up my&lt;br /&gt;
fears; I fell shrieking on the body of&lt;br /&gt;
my child, and rending away my hair,&lt;br /&gt;
endeavoured to recall him to life with&lt;br /&gt;
unavailing laments. Richard in the&lt;br /&gt;
mean while had quitted me, and the&lt;br /&gt;
moment after I beheld him mounted&lt;br /&gt;
on horseback, and stretching away to&lt;br /&gt;
the city. The Indians fired a volley&lt;br /&gt;
at him, but missed, and I flatter my-&lt;br /&gt;
self that he arrived safe–And now,&lt;br /&gt;
not all my prayers and tears could&lt;br /&gt;
prevent the wretches from scalping&lt;br /&gt;
my precious child. But when they&lt;br /&gt;
rent me away from him, and dragged&lt;br /&gt;
me from the house, my grief and&lt;br /&gt;
rage burst forth like a hurricane. I&lt;br /&gt;
execrated their whole race, and called&lt;br /&gt;
for eternal vengeance to crush them&lt;br /&gt;
to atoms. After a while I grew a-&lt;br /&gt;
shamed of my impetuosity; the tears&lt;br /&gt;
began again to flow silently on my&lt;br /&gt;
brow, and as I walked through the&lt;br /&gt;
forest between two Indians, my soul&lt;br /&gt;
grew suddenly sick and groaned in&lt;br /&gt;
me; a darkness more substantial than&lt;br /&gt;
Egyptian night fell upon it, and my&lt;br /&gt;
existence became an insupportable&lt;br /&gt;
burthen to me. I looked up to Hea-&lt;br /&gt;
ven with a hopeless kind of awe, but&lt;br /&gt;
I murmured no more at the dispensa-&lt;br /&gt;
tions of my God, and in this frame&lt;br /&gt;
of sullen resignation I passed the rest&lt;br /&gt;
of my journey, which being nearly&lt;br /&gt;
similar to Mrs. Kittle’s, I shall aboid&lt;br /&gt;
the repetition of. And now permit&lt;br /&gt;
me (said she, turning to the French&lt;br /&gt;
ladies) to acknowledge your extreme&lt;br /&gt;
goodness to me. I was a stranger,&lt;br /&gt;
sick and naked, and you took me in.&lt;br /&gt;
You indeed have proved the good Sa-&lt;br /&gt;
maritan to me, pouring oil and wine&lt;br /&gt;
in my wounds.” “Hush! hush!”&lt;br /&gt;
cried Madame de Roche, “you esti-&lt;br /&gt;
mate our services at too high a rate.&lt;br /&gt;
I see you are no connoisseur in minds;&lt;br /&gt;
there is a great deal of honest hospi-&lt;br /&gt;
tality in the world, though you have&lt;br /&gt;
met with so little.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I now reject,” interrupted Mrs.&lt;br /&gt;
Bratt, “all prejudices of education.&lt;br /&gt;
From my infancy have I been taught&lt;br /&gt;
that the French were a cruel perfidi-&lt;br /&gt;
ous enemy, but I have found them&lt;br /&gt;
quite the reverse.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Madame de R. willing to change&lt;br /&gt;
the subject, accosted the other stran-&lt;br /&gt;
ger–“Dear Mrs. Willis, shall we&lt;br /&gt;
not be interested likewise in your&lt;br /&gt;
misfortunes?”–“Ah! do,” added&lt;br /&gt;
Mademoiselle V. “my heart is now&lt;br /&gt;
sweetly tuned to melancholly. I love&lt;br /&gt;
to indulge these divine sensibilities,&lt;br /&gt;
which your affecting histories are so&lt;br /&gt;
capable of inspiring.” –Maria then&lt;br /&gt;
took hold of Mrs. Willis’s hand, and&lt;br /&gt;
pressed her to oblige them.–Mrs.&lt;br /&gt;
Willis bowed. She dropt a few tears;&lt;br /&gt;
but assuming a composed look, she&lt;br /&gt;
began–&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(To be continued.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[5. January 1791]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I am the daughter of a poor&lt;br /&gt;
clergyman, who being con-&lt;br /&gt;
fined to his chamber, by sickness, for&lt;br /&gt;
several years, amused himself by edu-&lt;br /&gt;
cating me. At his death, finding&lt;br /&gt;
myself friendless, and without mo-&lt;br /&gt;
ney, I accepted the hand of a young&lt;br /&gt;
man who had taken a leased farm in&lt;br /&gt;
Pennsylvania. He was very agree-&lt;br /&gt;
able, and extravagantly fond of me.&lt;br /&gt;
We lived happily for many years in&lt;br /&gt;
a kind of frugal affluence. When&lt;br /&gt;
the savages began to commit out-&lt;br /&gt;
rages on the frontier settlements, our&lt;br /&gt;
neighbours, intimidated at their ra-&lt;br /&gt;
pid approaches, erected a small fort,&lt;br /&gt;
surrounded by a high palisade. Into&lt;br /&gt;
this the more timorous drove their&lt;br /&gt;
cattle at night; and one evening, as&lt;br /&gt;
we were at supper, my husband (be-&lt;br /&gt;
ing ordered on guard) insisted that I&lt;br /&gt;
should accompany him with the chil-&lt;br /&gt;
dren (for I had two lovely girls, one&lt;br /&gt;
turned of thirteen years, and another&lt;br /&gt;
of six months.) My Sophia assented&lt;br /&gt;
to the proposal with joy. “Mamma,”&lt;br /&gt;
said she, “what a merry woman the&lt;br /&gt;
Captain’s wife is; she will divert us&lt;br /&gt;
the whole evening, and she is very&lt;br /&gt;
fond of your company: come, I&lt;br /&gt;
will take our little Charlotte on my&lt;br /&gt;
arm, and papa will carry the lan-&lt;br /&gt;
thorn.” I acceded with a nod; and&lt;br /&gt;
already the dear charmer had hand-&lt;br /&gt;
ed me my hat and gloves, when some-&lt;br /&gt;
body thundered at the door. We&lt;br /&gt;
were silent as death, and instantly&lt;br /&gt;
after plainly could distinguish the&lt;br /&gt;
voices of savages conferring together.&lt;br /&gt;
Chilled as I was with fear, I flew to&lt;br /&gt;
the cradle, and catching my infant,&lt;br /&gt;
ran up into a loft. Sophia followed&lt;br /&gt;
me all trembling, and panting for&lt;br /&gt;
breath cast herself in my bosom.&lt;br /&gt;
Hearing the Indians enter, I looked&lt;br /&gt;
through a crevice in the floor, and&lt;br /&gt;
saw them, with menacing looks, seat&lt;br /&gt;
themselves round the table, and now&lt;br /&gt;
and then addressed themselves to Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Willis, who, all pale and astonished,&lt;br /&gt;
neither understood nor had power to&lt;br /&gt;
answer them. I observed they took&lt;br /&gt;
a great pleasure in terrifying him,&lt;br /&gt;
by flourishing their knives, and gash-&lt;br /&gt;
ing the table with their hatchets.&lt;br /&gt;
Alas! this sight shot icicles to my&lt;br /&gt;
soul; and, to increase my distress,&lt;br /&gt;
my Sophia’s little heart beat against&lt;br /&gt;
my breath, with redoubled strokes, at&lt;br /&gt;
every word they uttered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Having finished their repast in&lt;br /&gt;
a gluttinous manner, they laid a fire-&lt;br /&gt;
brand in each corner of the chamber,&lt;br /&gt;
and then departed, driving poor Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Willis before them. The smoke soon&lt;br /&gt;
incommoded us; but we dreaded our&lt;br /&gt;
barbarous enemy more than the fire.&lt;br /&gt;
At length, however, the flames be-&lt;br /&gt;
ginning to invade our retreat, trem-&lt;br /&gt;
bling and apprehensive we ventured&lt;br /&gt;
down stairs; the whole house now&lt;br /&gt;
glowed like a furnace; the flames&lt;br /&gt;
rolled towards the stairs, which we&lt;br /&gt;
hastily descended; but just as I sat&lt;br /&gt;
my foot on the threshold of the door,&lt;br /&gt;
a piece of timber, nearly consumed&lt;br /&gt;
through, gave way, and fell on my&lt;br /&gt;
left arm, which supported my infant,&lt;br /&gt;
miserably fracturing the bone. I in-&lt;br /&gt;
stantly caught up my fallen lamb,&lt;br /&gt;
and hasted to overtake my Sophia.&lt;br /&gt;
There was a large hollow tree conti-&lt;br /&gt;
guous to our house, with an aperture&lt;br /&gt;
just large enough to admit so small a&lt;br /&gt;
woman as I am. Here we had often&lt;br /&gt;
laughingly proposed to hide our chil-&lt;br /&gt;
dren, in case of a visit from the olive&lt;br /&gt;
coloured natives. In this we now&lt;br /&gt;
took shelter; and being seated some&lt;br /&gt;
time, my soul seemed to awake as&lt;br /&gt;
it were from a vision of horror: I&lt;br /&gt;
lifted up my eyes, and beheld the&lt;br /&gt;
cottage that lately circumscribed all&lt;br /&gt;
my worldly wealth and delight,&lt;br /&gt;
melting away before the devouring&lt;br /&gt;
fire. I dropt a tear as our apostate&lt;br /&gt;
first parents did when thrust out from&lt;br /&gt;
Eden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The world lay all before them,&lt;br /&gt;
where to chuse their place of rest,&lt;br /&gt;
and Providence their guide. Ah!&lt;br /&gt;
Eve thought I, hadst thou been like&lt;br /&gt;
me, solitary, maimed, and unpro-&lt;br /&gt;
tected, thy situation had been deplo-&lt;br /&gt;
rable indeed. Then pressing my&lt;br /&gt;
babe to my heart, “how quiet art&lt;br /&gt;
thou, my angel,” said I; “sure–&lt;br /&gt;
sure, Heaven has stilled thy little&lt;br /&gt;
plaints in mercy to us.”–“Ah!”&lt;br /&gt;
sobbed Sophia, “now I am com-&lt;br /&gt;
forted again that I hear my dear&lt;br /&gt;
mamma’s voice. I was afraid grief&lt;br /&gt;
would have for ever deprived me of&lt;br /&gt;
that happiness.” And here she kissed&lt;br /&gt;
my babe and me with vehemence.&lt;br /&gt;
When her transports were moderated,&lt;br /&gt;
“how cold my sister is,” said she,&lt;br /&gt;
“do wrap her up warmer, mamma;&lt;br /&gt;
poor thing, she is not used to such&lt;br /&gt;
uncomfortable lodging.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The pain of my arm now called&lt;br /&gt;
for all my fortitude and attention;&lt;br /&gt;
but I forbore to mention this afflict-&lt;br /&gt;
ing circumstance to my daughter.&lt;br /&gt;
“The cheerful swallow now be-&lt;br /&gt;
gan to usher in the dawn with melo-&lt;br /&gt;
dy; we timidly prepared to quit our&lt;br /&gt;
hiding place; and turning round to&lt;br /&gt;
the light, I cast an anxious eye of&lt;br /&gt;
love on my innocent, wondering&lt;br /&gt;
that she slept so long. But oh! hor-&lt;br /&gt;
ror and misery! I beheld her a pale,&lt;br /&gt;
stiff corpse in my arms (suffer me to&lt;br /&gt;
weep, ladies, at the cruel recollect-&lt;br /&gt;
tion;) it seems the piece of wood&lt;br /&gt;
that disabled me, had also crushed my&lt;br /&gt;
Charlotte’s tender skull, and no won-&lt;br /&gt;
der my hapless babe was quiet. I&lt;br /&gt;
could no longer sustain my sorrowful&lt;br /&gt;
burden, but falling prostrate, almost&lt;br /&gt;
insensible, at the dreadful discovery,&lt;br /&gt;
uttered nothing but groans. Sophia’s&lt;br /&gt;
little heart was too susceptible for so&lt;br /&gt;
moving a scene. Distracted between&lt;br /&gt;
her concern for me, and her grief for&lt;br /&gt;
the loss of her dear sister, she cast&lt;br /&gt;
herself beside me, and with the soft-&lt;br /&gt;
est voice of sorrow, bewailed the fate&lt;br /&gt;
of her beloved Charlotte–her sweet&lt;br /&gt;
companion–her innocent, laughing&lt;br /&gt;
play-fellow. At length we rose,&lt;br /&gt;
and Sophia, clasping all that remain-&lt;br /&gt;
ed of my cherub in her arms, “Ah!”&lt;br /&gt;
said she, “I did engage to carry you,&lt;br /&gt;
my sister, but little did I expect in&lt;br /&gt;
this distressing manner.” When we&lt;br /&gt;
came in sight of the fort, though I&lt;br /&gt;
endeavoured to spirit up my grieved&lt;br /&gt;
child, yet I found my springs of ac-&lt;br /&gt;
tion began to move heavily, my&lt;br /&gt;
heart fluttered, and I suddenly faint-&lt;br /&gt;
ed away. Sophia, concluding I was&lt;br /&gt;
dead, uttered so piercing a cry, that&lt;br /&gt;
the centinel looking up, immediate-&lt;br /&gt;
ly called to those in the fort to assist&lt;br /&gt;
us. When I recovered, I found m-&lt;br /&gt;
self in a bed encircled by my kind&lt;br /&gt;
neighbours, who divided their ex-&lt;br /&gt;
pressions of love and condolement be-&lt;br /&gt;
tween me and my child. I remain-&lt;br /&gt;
ed in the fort after this; but, ladies,&lt;br /&gt;
you may think, that bereft as I was&lt;br /&gt;
of so kind a husband and endearing&lt;br /&gt;
child, I soon found myself solitary&lt;br /&gt;
and destitute. I wept incessantly;&lt;br /&gt;
and hearing nothing from my dear&lt;br /&gt;
Willis, I at length resolved to traverse&lt;br /&gt;
the wilds of Canada in pursuit of&lt;br /&gt;
him. When I communicated this to&lt;br /&gt;
my friends, they all strongly oppos-&lt;br /&gt;
ed it; but finding me inflexible, they&lt;br /&gt;
furnished me with some money and&lt;br /&gt;
necessaries, and obtained a permission&lt;br /&gt;
from the Governor to let me go un-&lt;br /&gt;
der protection of a flag that was on&lt;br /&gt;
the way. Hearing likewise that a&lt;br /&gt;
cartel was drawn for an exchange of&lt;br /&gt;
prisoners, I sat out, flushed with hope,&lt;br /&gt;
and with indefatigable industry and&lt;br /&gt;
painful solicitude, arrived at Mon-&lt;br /&gt;
treal, worn to a skeleton (as you see&lt;br /&gt;
ladies) with fatigue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I omitted not to enquire of every&lt;br /&gt;
officer, the names of prisoners who&lt;br /&gt;
had been brought in. At length I&lt;br /&gt;
understood that Mr. Willis had pe-&lt;br /&gt;
rished in jail, on his first arrival, of&lt;br /&gt;
a dysentery.–Here my expectations&lt;br /&gt;
terminated in despair. I had no mo-&lt;br /&gt;
ney to return with, and indeed but&lt;br /&gt;
for my Sophia no inclination–the&lt;br /&gt;
whole world seemed dark and chear-&lt;br /&gt;
less to me as the fabled region of Cim-&lt;br /&gt;
meria, and I was nigh perishing for&lt;br /&gt;
very want, when Mrs. Bratt, hearing&lt;br /&gt;
of my distress, sought my acquaint-&lt;br /&gt;
ance: she kindly participated my&lt;br /&gt;
sorrows, and too–too generously&lt;br /&gt;
shared her purse and bed with me.–&lt;br /&gt;
This, ladies, is the story of a broken-&lt;br /&gt;
hearted woman; nor should I have&lt;br /&gt;
intruded it in any other but the house&lt;br /&gt;
of mourning.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here she concluded, while the&lt;br /&gt;
ladies severally embracing her, ex-&lt;br /&gt;
pressed their acknowledgements for&lt;br /&gt;
the painful task she had complied&lt;br /&gt;
with to oblige their curiosity–&lt;br /&gt;
“Would to Heaven!” said Madame&lt;br /&gt;
de R–, “that the brutal nations were&lt;br /&gt;
extinct, for never–never can the&lt;br /&gt;
united humanity of France and Bri-&lt;br /&gt;
tain compensate for the horrid cruel-&lt;br /&gt;
ties of their savage allies.”&lt;br /&gt;
They were soon after summoned&lt;br /&gt;
to an elegant collation; and having&lt;br /&gt;
spent best part of the night together,&lt;br /&gt;
the guests retired to their respective&lt;br /&gt;
homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During two years, in which the&lt;br /&gt;
French ladies continued their boun-&lt;br /&gt;
ty and friendship to Mrs. Kittle, she&lt;br /&gt;
never could gain the least intelligence&lt;br /&gt;
of her husband. Her letters, after&lt;br /&gt;
wandering through several provinces,&lt;br /&gt;
would often return to her hands un-&lt;br /&gt;
opened. Despairing at length of ever&lt;br /&gt;
seeing him, “ah!” she would say to&lt;br /&gt;
Mrs. D–, “my poof husband has&lt;br /&gt;
undoubtedly perished, perhaps in his&lt;br /&gt;
fruitless search after me, and I am&lt;br /&gt;
left to be a long–long burden on&lt;br /&gt;
your goodness, a very unprofitable&lt;br /&gt;
dependant.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her friend’s absence she would&lt;br /&gt;
descend into the kitchen, and submit&lt;br /&gt;
to the most menial offices; nor could&lt;br /&gt;
the servants prevent her; however,&lt;br /&gt;
the apprised Mrs. D–of it, who&lt;br /&gt;
seized an opportunity of detecting her&lt;br /&gt;
at her labour. Being baffled in her&lt;br /&gt;
humble attempt by the gentle re-&lt;br /&gt;
proaches of her indulgent patroness,&lt;br /&gt;
she sat down on the step of the door,&lt;br /&gt;
and began to weep. “I believe,&lt;br /&gt;
good Mrs. D–,” said she, “were&lt;br /&gt;
you a hard task-master, that exacted&lt;br /&gt;
from these useless hands the most sla-&lt;br /&gt;
vish business, I could acquit myself&lt;br /&gt;
with cheerfulness: my heart is like&lt;br /&gt;
ice, that brightens and grows firmer&lt;br /&gt;
by tempests, but cannot stand the&lt;br /&gt;
warm rays of a kind sun.” Mrs.&lt;br /&gt;
D–was beginning to answer,&lt;br /&gt;
when hearing a tumult in the street,&lt;br /&gt;
they both hasted to the door, and&lt;br /&gt;
Maria, casting her eyes carelessly over&lt;br /&gt;
the crowd, in an instant recognized&lt;br /&gt;
the features of her long-lamented&lt;br /&gt;
husband, who sprang towards her&lt;br /&gt;
with an undescribable and involunta-&lt;br /&gt;
ry rapture; but the tide of joy and&lt;br /&gt;
surprise was too strong for the de-&lt;br /&gt;
licacy of her frame. She gave a&lt;br /&gt;
faint exclamation, and stretching out&lt;br /&gt;
her arms to receive him, dropped&lt;br /&gt;
senseless at his feet. The succession&lt;br /&gt;
of his ideas were too rapid to admit&lt;br /&gt;
describing. He caught her up, and&lt;br /&gt;
bearing her in the hall, laid his pre-&lt;br /&gt;
cious burden on a settee, kneeling be-&lt;br /&gt;
side her in a speechless agony of de-&lt;br /&gt;
light and concern. Mean while the&lt;br /&gt;
spectators found themselves wonder-&lt;br /&gt;
fully affected–the tender contagion&lt;br /&gt;
ran from bosom to bosom–they wept&lt;br /&gt;
aloud; and the house of joy seemed&lt;br /&gt;
to be the house of lamentation. At&lt;br /&gt;
length Maria opened her eyes and&lt;br /&gt;
burst into a violent fit of tears–Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Kittle, with answering emotions, si-&lt;br /&gt;
lently accompanying her; then clasp-&lt;br /&gt;
ing his arms endearingly round her,&lt;br /&gt;
“it is enough, my love,” said he;&lt;br /&gt;
“we have had our night of affliction,&lt;br /&gt;
and surely this blessed meeting is a&lt;br /&gt;
presage of a long day of future hap-&lt;br /&gt;
pines; let me kiss off those tears,&lt;br /&gt;
and shew by your smiles that I am&lt;br /&gt;
indeed welcome.” Maria then bend-&lt;br /&gt;
ing fondly forward to his bosom, re-&lt;br /&gt;
plied, sighing, “alas! how can your&lt;br /&gt;
beggared wife give you a proper re-&lt;br /&gt;
ception!–she cannot restore your&lt;br /&gt;
prattling babes to your arms!–she&lt;br /&gt;
comes alone–alas! her presence will&lt;br /&gt;
only serve to remind you of the trea-&lt;br /&gt;
sures–the filial delights you have&lt;br /&gt;
lost.”–“God forbid,” answered he,&lt;br /&gt;
“that I should repine at the loss of&lt;br /&gt;
my smaller comforts, when so capital&lt;br /&gt;
a blessing as my beloved Maria is so&lt;br /&gt;
wonderfully restored to me.” Here&lt;br /&gt;
he was in civility obliged to rise and&lt;br /&gt;
receive the compliments of Mrs.&lt;br /&gt;
Bratt, Mrs. Willis, and Madame de&lt;br /&gt;
R–, who, hearing of his arrival,&lt;br /&gt;
entered just then half breathless, with&lt;br /&gt;
impatience and joy. The company&lt;br /&gt;
encreased. An elegant dinner was&lt;br /&gt;
prepared. In short, the day was de-&lt;br /&gt;
voted to pleasure; and never was&lt;br /&gt;
satisfaction more general–festivity&lt;br /&gt;
glowed on every face, and compla-&lt;br /&gt;
cency dimpled every cheek.&lt;br /&gt;
After tea Maria withdrew in the&lt;br /&gt;
garden, to give her beloved an ac-&lt;br /&gt;
count of what had befallen her dur-&lt;br /&gt;
ing their separation. The eloquence&lt;br /&gt;
of sorrow is irresistible. Mr. Kittle&lt;br /&gt;
wept, he groaned, while all impassi-&lt;br /&gt;
oned (with long interruptions of grief&lt;br /&gt;
in her voice) she stammered through&lt;br /&gt;
her doleful history, and yet she felt&lt;br /&gt;
a great satisfaction in pouring her&lt;br /&gt;
complaints into a bosom whose feel-&lt;br /&gt;
ings were in unison with her’s–they&lt;br /&gt;
wept–the smiled–they mourned,&lt;br /&gt;
and rejoiced alternately, with an&lt;br /&gt;
abrupt transition from one passion to&lt;br /&gt;
another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Kittle, in return, informed&lt;br /&gt;
her, that having thrown himself&lt;br /&gt;
into the army, in hopes of ending a&lt;br /&gt;
being that grew insupportable under&lt;br /&gt;
the reflection of past happiness–he&lt;br /&gt;
tempted death in every action where-&lt;br /&gt;
in he was engaged, and being dis-&lt;br /&gt;
appointed, gave himself up to the&lt;br /&gt;
blackest melancholy. “This gloomy&lt;br /&gt;
scene,” he observed, “would soon&lt;br /&gt;
have been closed by some act of des-&lt;br /&gt;
peration, but one evening, sitting&lt;br /&gt;
pensive in his tent, and attentively&lt;br /&gt;
running over the circumstances of his&lt;br /&gt;
misfortunes, a thought darted on his&lt;br /&gt;
mind that possibly his brother Henry&lt;br /&gt;
might be alive.” This was the first&lt;br /&gt;
time the idea of any one of his fa-&lt;br /&gt;
mily’s surviving the general murder&lt;br /&gt;
had presented itself to him, and he&lt;br /&gt;
caught at the flattering suggestion as&lt;br /&gt;
a drowning wretch would to a plank.&lt;br /&gt;
“Surely–surely,” said he, “my bro-&lt;br /&gt;
ther lives–it is some divine emana-&lt;br /&gt;
tion lights up the thought in my soul&lt;br /&gt;
–it carries conviction with it–I&lt;br /&gt;
will go after him–it shall be the&lt;br /&gt;
comfort and employment of my life&lt;br /&gt;
to find out this dear brother–this last&lt;br /&gt;
and only treasure.” Persuaded of&lt;br /&gt;
the reality of his fancy, he commu-&lt;br /&gt;
nicated his design to a few of his mi-&lt;br /&gt;
litary friends; but they only laughed&lt;br /&gt;
at his extravagance, and strongly&lt;br /&gt;
dissuaded him from so wild an un-&lt;br /&gt;
dertaking. Being discouraged, he&lt;br /&gt;
desisted; but shortly after, hearing&lt;br /&gt;
that a company of prisoners (who&lt;br /&gt;
were enfranchised) were returning to&lt;br /&gt;
Quebec, he got permission to accom-&lt;br /&gt;
pany them. After a very fatiguing&lt;br /&gt;
journey he arrived at Montreal, and&lt;br /&gt;
was immediately introduced to the&lt;br /&gt;
General Officer, who patiently heard&lt;br /&gt;
his story, and treated him with great&lt;br /&gt;
clemency. Having obtained leave to&lt;br /&gt;
remain a few days in town, he re-&lt;br /&gt;
spectfully withdrew, and turning&lt;br /&gt;
down a street, he enquired of a man&lt;br /&gt;
who was walking before him, where&lt;br /&gt;
lodgings were to be let? The stran-&lt;br /&gt;
ger turned about, civily taking off&lt;br /&gt;
his hat, when Mr. Kittle, starting&lt;br /&gt;
back, grew as pale as ashes–“Oh,&lt;br /&gt;
my God!” cried he, panting, “oh!&lt;br /&gt;
Henry, is it you! is it indeed you!&lt;br /&gt;
No, it cannot be!” Here he was&lt;br /&gt;
ready to fall; but Henry, with little&lt;br /&gt;
less agitation, supported him; and a&lt;br /&gt;
tavern being at hand, he led him in.&lt;br /&gt;
The master of the hotel brought in&lt;br /&gt;
wine, and they drank off many glasses&lt;br /&gt;
to congratulate so happy a meeting.&lt;br /&gt;
When their transports were abated,&lt;br /&gt;
Henry ventured to tell him that his&lt;br /&gt;
Maria was living and well. This&lt;br /&gt;
was a weight of joy too strong for&lt;br /&gt;
his enfeebled powers–he stared wild-&lt;br /&gt;
ly about. At length, recovering him-&lt;br /&gt;
self, “take care, Henry,” said he,&lt;br /&gt;
“this is too tender a point to trifle&lt;br /&gt;
upon.”–“My brother,” replied&lt;br /&gt;
Henry, “be calm, let not your joy&lt;br /&gt;
have a worse effect than your grief–&lt;br /&gt;
they both came sudden, and it be-&lt;br /&gt;
hoves a man and a christian to shew&lt;br /&gt;
as much fortitude under the one as&lt;br /&gt;
the other.”–“Alas! I am prepared&lt;br /&gt;
for some woeful deception,” cried&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Kittle; “but, Henry, this sus-&lt;br /&gt;
pence is cruel.”–“By the eternal&lt;br /&gt;
God!” rejoined his brother, “your&lt;br /&gt;
Maria–your wife–is in this town,&lt;br /&gt;
and if you are composed enough,&lt;br /&gt;
shall immediately see her. Mr. Kit-&lt;br /&gt;
tle could not speak–he gave his hand&lt;br /&gt;
to Henry, and while (like the Apos-&lt;br /&gt;
tles friends) he believed not for joy,&lt;br /&gt;
he was conducted to her arms, and&lt;br /&gt;
found his bliss wonderfully real.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Early American Serialized Novels</name></author><summary type="html">On This Page</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">The Foresters</title><link href="https://earlyamericanserializednovels.github.io/the-foresters/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Foresters" /><published>1787-07-01T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>1787-07-01T00:00:00-07:00</updated><id>https://earlyamericanserializednovels.github.io/the-foresters</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://earlyamericanserializednovels.github.io/the-foresters/">&lt;nav class=&quot;toc&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/nav&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;preface&quot;&gt;Preface&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Columbian Magazine&lt;/em&gt; was one of the most successful early American magazines. It was founded by Mathew Carey, Charles Cist, Thomas Seddon, William Spotswood, and John Trenchard. The first issue of the magazine was published in September of 1786 and the magazine ran until 1792. The editors included the initial founders as well as, at various times, Francis Hopkinson, James Dallas, and an anonymous “society of gentlemen.” It had the largest circulation of eighteenth-century American magazines, with 1,500 subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It notably included fiction, as this was unusual at that time. Most issues had two or three stories, all of which were written and published anonymously. As Frank Luther Mott explains, these fictional stories ranged widely, including “oriental tales, allegories, characters, moral ‘novels,’ or ‘fragments” (96). The magazine also contained travel writing, such as descriptions of less commonly known American regions, as well as the types of essay series common to many magazines. According to Jared Gardner, the magazine “sought to create not an ephemeral periodical production but a lasting monument upon which a national literary culture might be built” (82). This fiction was often, as with both &lt;em&gt;The Foresters&lt;/em&gt; and a “fragment” piece entitled &lt;em&gt;Shipwreck&lt;/em&gt;, written as a transparent allegory for the new nation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The magazine often focused on agriculture and mechanics, for instance an illustrated description of John Fitch’s steamboat. It later began to focus more on biography and history. For instance, Jeremy Belknap wrote biographical sketches that were later collected into a single volume. The magazine’s contributors also discussed educational methods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;em&gt;Columbian&lt;/em&gt; notably published historical articles, including a history of the Revolution. In its later guise of the &lt;em&gt;Universal Asylum and Columbian Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, begun in January 1790, it focused on presenting narratives and documents about the history of the Revolutionary War. Once renamed to the &lt;em&gt;Universal Asylum and Columbian Magazine&lt;/em&gt;, an anonymous “Society of Gentlemen” published it. It had fewer illustrations at this point, although it was still engraved by Thackara and Vallance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this version, it continued to be printed for almost three years, and sometimes these issues proved popular enough to warrant a printing of a second edition. The magazine was discontinued in 1792. According to &lt;em&gt;A History of American Magazines&lt;/em&gt;, this was due to “the difficulties afforded by the new postoffice law of that year” rather than a lack of public interest or subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;According to &lt;em&gt;Literature Criticism from 1400 to 1800&lt;/em&gt;, Belknap initially published &lt;em&gt;The Foresters&lt;/em&gt; anonymously. Although it sold well and circulated widely, and William Cullent Bryant praised it in a review, its initial public did not know &lt;em&gt;The Foresters&lt;/em&gt;’ authorship. They did likely recognize its debt to John Arbuthnot’s &lt;em&gt;History of John Bull&lt;/em&gt;, which was published in 1712.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Foresters&lt;/em&gt; was partially serialized in the magazine from its June 1787 issue to its April 1788 issue. The novel’s publication frequency was monthly for most of its serialization, although the final few installments were instead spaced two months apart. The novel subsequently was later twice published as a self-contained book, first in 1792 and again in 1796.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Foresters&lt;/em&gt; presents an atypical and satirical allegory for the founding of such a recently independent nation. As Gardner assert, &lt;em&gt;The Foresters&lt;/em&gt; “uses allegory and satire to argue for natural hierarchy and the need for a strong federal government” (83). While this is true, it is worth emphasizing that each colony is characterized differently. All are given male personas, and the collection bursts with diverse economic, religious, and temperamental dispositions. Some have better relationships with John Bull than others. Native Americans are only somewhat depicted as varied amongst themselves. All the indigenous cultures and nations lumped together and depicted as “wild beasts,” with some individual beasts lured into civilization through their desire for molasses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rather than manufacturing a simple unity through similarity or nationalist fellow-feeling, the installments in &lt;em&gt;Columbia&lt;/em&gt; magazine conclude with an emergent recognition of shared mistreatment rather than innate affinity. These foresters recognize themselves as an emergent unit in relation to John Bull rather than recognizing an overriding similarity among themselves. By presenting less a foundational mythology of noble aspirations than a satirical, at times even coarsely comedic tale focusing on material and cultural concerns, Belknap’s novel emphasizes the many aspects of difference, discord, and disagreement among its characters as much as it does shared situation and fellow-feeling. The foresters’ turn toward unification seems very reluctant and a direct effect of their collective mistreatment by John Bull. Belknap depicts the emergent country arising from a situational adherence rather than an innate national coherence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THE FORESTERS,\
&lt;em&gt;An&lt;/em&gt; AMERICAN TALE, &lt;em&gt;being a Sequel to the History of&lt;/em&gt; JOHN BULL, &lt;em&gt;the
Clothier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EVERY one who has read the&lt;br /&gt;
history of &lt;em&gt;John Bull&lt;/em&gt;, the&lt;br /&gt;
clothier, must have observed, that&lt;br /&gt;
though “he was in the main an ho-&lt;br /&gt;
nest, plain dealing fellow, yet he&lt;br /&gt;
was choleric and inconstant, and ve-&lt;br /&gt;
ry apt to quarrel with his best&lt;br /&gt;
friends.” This observation we shall&lt;br /&gt;
find fully verified in the course of&lt;br /&gt;
the following narrative; and as the&lt;br /&gt;
opinions and manners of superiors&lt;br /&gt;
have a very great influence in form-&lt;br /&gt;
ing the character of inferiors, we&lt;br /&gt;
need not be surprized if we find a&lt;br /&gt;
family likeness prevailing among the&lt;br /&gt;
persons whose history we are about&lt;br /&gt;
to recite, most, of whom were form-&lt;br /&gt;
erly residents in Mr. Bull’s house,&lt;br /&gt;
or apprentices in his shop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was among the appen-&lt;br /&gt;
dages to John’s estate, a pretty large&lt;br /&gt;
tract of land, which had been ne-&lt;br /&gt;
glected by his ancestors, and which&lt;br /&gt;
he never cared much about, except-&lt;br /&gt;
ing that now and then some of his&lt;br /&gt;
family went thither a-hunting, and&lt;br /&gt;
brought home venison and furs. In-&lt;br /&gt;
deed this was as far as I can find the&lt;br /&gt;
best pretence that John had to call&lt;br /&gt;
the land his; for he had no legal&lt;br /&gt;
title to it. It was then a very woody&lt;br /&gt;
country, in some parts rocky and&lt;br /&gt;
hilly, in other parts level; well wa-&lt;br /&gt;
tered with brooks and ponds, and&lt;br /&gt;
the whole of it bordered on a large&lt;br /&gt;
lake, in which were plenty of fish,&lt;br /&gt;
some of which were often served up&lt;br /&gt;
at John’s table, on fast-days.&lt;br /&gt;
The stories told by one and an-&lt;br /&gt;
other of these adventurers, had made&lt;br /&gt;
a deep impression on the mind of &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Walter Pipe-Weed&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:1&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:1&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ) one of John’s&lt;br /&gt;
domestics, a fellow of a roving and&lt;br /&gt;
projecting disposition, and who had&lt;br /&gt;
learned the art of surveying. Walter&lt;br /&gt;
having frequently listened to their&lt;br /&gt;
chat, began to think within him-&lt;br /&gt;
self, “If these fellows make so ma-&lt;br /&gt;
ny pence by their excursions to this&lt;br /&gt;
wild spot, what might not I gain&lt;br /&gt;
by sitting down upon it ? There is&lt;br /&gt;
plenty of game and fish at hand, for&lt;br /&gt;
a present supply; plenty of nuts&lt;br /&gt;
and acorns to fatten pigs, and with&lt;br /&gt;
some small labour I may be able&lt;br /&gt;
to raise corn and feed poultry, which&lt;br /&gt;
will fetch me a good price at mar-&lt;br /&gt;
ket.–I can carry bisket enough in&lt;br /&gt;
my pockets, to keep me alive till my&lt;br /&gt;
first crop comes in, and my dog can&lt;br /&gt;
live upon the offals of the game that&lt;br /&gt;
I shall kill.–Besides, who knows&lt;br /&gt;
what treasures the land itself may&lt;br /&gt;
contain–perhaps some rich mines !&lt;br /&gt;
–od zounds!–then I am made for&lt;br /&gt;
this world.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full of this dream, Walter ap-&lt;br /&gt;
plied to his master one day for a&lt;br /&gt;
lease of part of &lt;em&gt;the forest&lt;/em&gt;, as it was&lt;br /&gt;
called. Bull at first laughed at the&lt;br /&gt;
proposal, and put him off; but Wal-&lt;br /&gt;
ter followed it up so close, and told&lt;br /&gt;
what advantages might be gained&lt;br /&gt;
by settling there, and promised, if&lt;br /&gt;
he should succeed, to turn all his&lt;br /&gt;
trade into his master’s hand, and&lt;br /&gt;
give him the refusal of whatever he&lt;br /&gt;
might bring to market, and withal&lt;br /&gt;
shewed him some draughts, which&lt;br /&gt;
he had made with chalk, from the&lt;br /&gt;
reports of the huntsmen, that Bull&lt;br /&gt;
began to think of the matter in good&lt;br /&gt;
earnest, and consulted his lawyer&lt;br /&gt;
upon the subject, who, after due&lt;br /&gt;
consideration of the premises, and&lt;br /&gt;
stroking his band, advised him as&lt;br /&gt;
follows. “Why yes, Mr. Bull, I&lt;br /&gt;
don’t see why you ought not to&lt;br /&gt;
look about you as well as your neigh-&lt;br /&gt;
bours. There is &lt;em&gt;Lord Street&lt;/em&gt;–he&lt;br /&gt;
has a large manor adjoining to your&lt;br /&gt;
forest, which, they say, yields him a&lt;br /&gt;
fine rent, and, who knows, but this&lt;br /&gt;
may bring you in as much, or more?&lt;br /&gt;
–Then there is old &lt;em&gt;Lewis&lt;/em&gt;, the cud-&lt;br /&gt;
gel-player, and &lt;em&gt;Nic Frog&lt;/em&gt;, the dra-&lt;br /&gt;
per, who have, perhaps, (I say &lt;em&gt;per- *&lt;br /&gt;
*haps&lt;/em&gt;, Mr. Bull, because it may be&lt;br /&gt;
a little doubtful on both sides, and&lt;br /&gt;
in that case, you know, sir, it would&lt;br /&gt;
not become gentlemen of our cloth,&lt;br /&gt;
to speak positively) as good a claim&lt;br /&gt;
as your honor to this land; but then&lt;br /&gt;
it is a maxim, you know, that pos-&lt;br /&gt;
session is eleven points of the law,&lt;br /&gt;
and if you once get your foot upon&lt;br /&gt;
it–they can not out you without a&lt;br /&gt;
process, and your honor knows that&lt;br /&gt;
your purse is as long as theirs, and&lt;br /&gt;
you are as able to stand a suit with&lt;br /&gt;
them as they are with you. I there-&lt;br /&gt;
fore advise you to humour your man&lt;br /&gt;
Walter, and give him a lease, and a&lt;br /&gt;
pretty large one–you may find&lt;br /&gt;
more advantages in it than you are&lt;br /&gt;
aware of–but lease it, lease it at any&lt;br /&gt;
rate.” Upon this he was ordered&lt;br /&gt;
to make out a lease; and Walter be-&lt;br /&gt;
ing thus invested with as good au-&lt;br /&gt;
thority as could be obtained, filled&lt;br /&gt;
his pockets with bread and cheese,&lt;br /&gt;
took his gun, powder-flask, and shot&lt;br /&gt;
of various kinds, with a parcel of&lt;br /&gt;
fishing-lines and hooks, his survey-&lt;br /&gt;
ing instruments, and a bag of corn&lt;br /&gt;
on his shoulders, and off he trotted&lt;br /&gt;
to his new paradise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was some time before he could&lt;br /&gt;
fix upon a spot to his liking, and he&lt;br /&gt;
at first met with some opposition&lt;br /&gt;
from the bears and wolves, and was&lt;br /&gt;
greatly exposed to the weather,&lt;br /&gt;
before he could build him a hut;&lt;br /&gt;
once or twice the savage animals had&lt;br /&gt;
almost devoured him, but being&lt;br /&gt;
made of good stuff, he stood his&lt;br /&gt;
ground, cleared a little spot, put his&lt;br /&gt;
seed into the earth, and lived as well&lt;br /&gt;
as such adventurers can expect, poor-&lt;br /&gt;
ly enough at first, but supported by&lt;br /&gt;
the hope of better times. After a&lt;br /&gt;
while he began to thrive, and his&lt;br /&gt;
master Bull recommended a &lt;em&gt;wife&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:2&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
to whom he married, and by whom&lt;br /&gt;
he had a number of children. Hav-&lt;br /&gt;
ing found a new sort of grain in the&lt;br /&gt;
forest, and a certain plant of a nar-&lt;br /&gt;
cotic quality, he cultivated both,&lt;br /&gt;
and having procured a number of&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:3&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:3&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;em&gt;black-cattle&lt;/em&gt;, he went on pretty&lt;br /&gt;
gaily in the planting way, and&lt;br /&gt;
brought his narcotic weed into great&lt;br /&gt;
repute, by sending a present of a&lt;br /&gt;
quantity of it to his old master, who&lt;br /&gt;
grew excessively fond of it, and kept&lt;br /&gt;
calling for more, till he got the&lt;br /&gt;
whole trade of it into his own hands,&lt;br /&gt;
and sold it out of his own ware-house&lt;br /&gt;
to old Lewis, Nic Frog, and all the&lt;br /&gt;
other tradesmen around him. In&lt;br /&gt;
return he supplied Walter with&lt;br /&gt;
cloths and stuffs for his family, and&lt;br /&gt;
utensils for his husbandry; and as&lt;br /&gt;
a reward for being the first, who had&lt;br /&gt;
courage to make a settlement in his&lt;br /&gt;
forest, and in token of his high es-&lt;br /&gt;
teem of him as a customer, as well as&lt;br /&gt;
for certain other reasons, he made&lt;br /&gt;
it a practice every year, to present&lt;br /&gt;
him with a waggon-load of ordure, &lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:4&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:4&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) the sweepings of his back-yard,&lt;br /&gt;
the scrapings of his dog-kennel, and&lt;br /&gt;
contents of his own water closet.&lt;br /&gt;
This was a mark of politeness which&lt;br /&gt;
John valued himself much upon. “It&lt;br /&gt;
may seem odd (said he one day to a&lt;br /&gt;
friend) that I make such a kind of&lt;br /&gt;
compliment as this to my good cus-&lt;br /&gt;
tomer; but if you consider it a-&lt;br /&gt;
right you will find it a piece of re-&lt;br /&gt;
fined policy–for by this means I&lt;br /&gt;
get rid of a deal of trash and rub-&lt;br /&gt;
bish that is necessarily made in such&lt;br /&gt;
a family as mine; I get a cursed&lt;br /&gt;
stink removed from under my nose,&lt;br /&gt;
and my good friend has the advan-&lt;br /&gt;
tage of it upon his farm, to manure&lt;br /&gt;
his grounds, and make them produce&lt;br /&gt;
more plentifully that precious weed&lt;br /&gt;
in which we all so much delight.”&lt;br /&gt;
Walter was often seen, on the arri-&lt;br /&gt;
val of Bull’s waggon, to clap his&lt;br /&gt;
handkerchief to his nose; but as he&lt;br /&gt;
knew his old master was an odd sort&lt;br /&gt;
of a fellow, and it was his interest&lt;br /&gt;
to keep in with him, he generally&lt;br /&gt;
turned off the compliment with a&lt;br /&gt;
laugh, saying, good naturedly e-&lt;br /&gt;
nough, “Let him laugh that wins,”&lt;br /&gt;
without explaining his meaning, tho’&lt;br /&gt;
it might admit of a &lt;em&gt;double entendre&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
–and calling some of his servants,&lt;br /&gt;
he ordered them to shovel out the&lt;br /&gt;
dung, and make his black cattle mix&lt;br /&gt;
theirs with it–and when spread over&lt;br /&gt;
the land, the air took out most of&lt;br /&gt;
the scent, and the salts were of some&lt;br /&gt;
advantage to the soil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After Walter Pipe-weed had got&lt;br /&gt;
his affairs into tolerable order, he&lt;br /&gt;
was visited in his retirement by &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Frederick Peterson&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:5&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:5&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;5&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), another of&lt;br /&gt;
Bull’s apprentices, who had taken&lt;br /&gt;
a fancy to the same kind of life,&lt;br /&gt;
from a disgust to some things that&lt;br /&gt;
had happened in the family. He&lt;br /&gt;
had not been long with Walter be-&lt;br /&gt;
fore he found it would not do for&lt;br /&gt;
him to remain there. Frederick&lt;br /&gt;
was supposed to be a natural son of&lt;br /&gt;
old &lt;em&gt;Lord Peter&lt;/em&gt;, after whom he was&lt;br /&gt;
nick-named. He had the same af-&lt;br /&gt;
fected airs, and a tincture of the&lt;br /&gt;
high flying notions of his reputed fa-&lt;br /&gt;
ther. These made him rather dis-&lt;br /&gt;
gustful to Walter, who had learned&lt;br /&gt;
his manners of Mr. Bull’s mother,&lt;br /&gt;
when she was in her sober senses,&lt;br /&gt;
and between her and Lord Peter&lt;br /&gt;
there had been a long variance.&lt;br /&gt;
When Frederick perceived that his&lt;br /&gt;
company was not desired, he had so&lt;br /&gt;
much good sense as to leave Walter’s&lt;br /&gt;
plantation, and paddling across a&lt;br /&gt;
creek, seated himself on a point of&lt;br /&gt;
land that ran out into the lake. Of&lt;br /&gt;
this he obtained a lease of his old&lt;br /&gt;
master, and went to work in the&lt;br /&gt;
same manner as Walter had done,&lt;br /&gt;
who, liking his company best at a&lt;br /&gt;
distance, was willing to supply him&lt;br /&gt;
with bread and meat till he could&lt;br /&gt;
scramble for himself. Here he took&lt;br /&gt;
to husbandry, raising corn and the&lt;br /&gt;
narcotic weed, and buying up &lt;em&gt;black *&lt;br /&gt;
*cattle&lt;/em&gt;, and after a while turned his&lt;br /&gt;
produce into his old master’s ware-&lt;br /&gt;
house, and received from him the&lt;br /&gt;
annual compliment of a waggon-&lt;br /&gt;
load of dung, excepting that when&lt;br /&gt;
there had not been so much as usual&lt;br /&gt;
made, he and Walter were to share&lt;br /&gt;
a load between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To ingratiate himself still farther&lt;br /&gt;
with his old master, he accepted of&lt;br /&gt;
a girl out of his family for a wife,&lt;br /&gt;
(for John was always fond of his&lt;br /&gt;
tenants marrying for fear of their&lt;br /&gt;
doing worse) he took as little notice&lt;br /&gt;
as possible of his reputed father, and&lt;br /&gt;
dropping, or disowning his nick-&lt;br /&gt;
name of Peterson, he assumed that of &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Marygold&lt;/em&gt;, which old Madam Bull&lt;br /&gt;
understood as a compliment to one&lt;br /&gt;
of her daughters.–He also made&lt;br /&gt;
his court to the old lady by kneel-&lt;br /&gt;
ing down and kissing the fringe of&lt;br /&gt;
her embroidered petticoat, as was&lt;br /&gt;
the fashion of that day. This cere-&lt;br /&gt;
mony, tho’ a trifle in itself, helped&lt;br /&gt;
much to recommend him to Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Bull, who was a very dutiful son,&lt;br /&gt;
and took his mother’s advice in most&lt;br /&gt;
parts of his business. In short, Fre-&lt;br /&gt;
derick was too much of a politician&lt;br /&gt;
to suppose that filial affection ought&lt;br /&gt;
to stand in the way of a man’s inte-&lt;br /&gt;
rest, and in this he judged as most&lt;br /&gt;
other men would have done in the&lt;br /&gt;
same circumstances.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;To be continued.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[2. July 1787]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FORESTERS, &lt;em&gt;An&lt;/em&gt; AMERICAN TALE, &lt;em&gt;being a Sequel to the History of&lt;/em&gt;
JOHN BULL, &lt;em&gt;the Clothier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Continued from Page 456.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ABOUT the time in which&lt;br /&gt;
these first attempts were mak-&lt;br /&gt;
ing, and the fame of them had&lt;br /&gt;
raised much jealousy among some,&lt;br /&gt;
and much expectation among others,&lt;br /&gt;
there happened a sad quarrel in John&lt;br /&gt;
Bull’s family. His mother, (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:6&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:6&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;6&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) poor&lt;br /&gt;
Woman, had been seized with hyste-&lt;br /&gt;
ric fits, which caused her at times&lt;br /&gt;
to be delirious and full of all sorts&lt;br /&gt;
of whims. She had taken it into&lt;br /&gt;
her head that every one of the fa-&lt;br /&gt;
mily must hold knife and fork and&lt;br /&gt;
spoon exactly alike; that they must&lt;br /&gt;
all wash their hands and face pre-&lt;br /&gt;
cisely in the same manner; that&lt;br /&gt;
they must sit, stand, walk, kneel,&lt;br /&gt;
bow, spit, blow their noses, and&lt;br /&gt;
perform every other animal function&lt;br /&gt;
by the exact rule of &lt;em&gt;uniformity&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
which she had drawn up with her&lt;br /&gt;
own hand, and from which they&lt;br /&gt;
were not allowed to vary one hair’s&lt;br /&gt;
breadth. If any one of the family&lt;br /&gt;
complained of a lame ancle or stiff&lt;br /&gt;
knee, or had the crick in his neck,&lt;br /&gt;
or happened to cut his finger, or&lt;br /&gt;
was any other way so disabled as not&lt;br /&gt;
to perform his duty to a tittle, she&lt;br /&gt;
was so far from making the least al-&lt;br /&gt;
lowance, that she would frown and&lt;br /&gt;
scold and rave like a bedlamite; and&lt;br /&gt;
John was such an obedient son to his&lt;br /&gt;
mother, that he would lend her his&lt;br /&gt;
hand to cut their ears, or his foot&lt;br /&gt;
to kick their backsides, for not com-&lt;br /&gt;
plying with her humours. This&lt;br /&gt;
way of proceeding raised an uproar&lt;br /&gt;
in the family; for though most of&lt;br /&gt;
them complied, either through af-&lt;br /&gt;
fection for the old lady, or through&lt;br /&gt;
fear, or some other motive, yet&lt;br /&gt;
others looked sour, and grumbled;&lt;br /&gt;
some would openly find fault and&lt;br /&gt;
attempt to remonstrate, but they&lt;br /&gt;
were answered with a kick or a&lt;br /&gt;
thump, or a cat-o’nine tails, or shut&lt;br /&gt;
up in a dark garret ‘till they pro-&lt;br /&gt;
mised a compliance. Such was the&lt;br /&gt;
logic of the family in those days!&lt;br /&gt;
Among the number of the disaf-&lt;br /&gt;
fected, was PEREGRINE PICKLE, (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:7&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:7&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;7&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;br /&gt;
a pretty honest, clever sort of a fel-&lt;br /&gt;
low about his business, but a great&lt;br /&gt;
lover of sour crout, and of an hu-&lt;br /&gt;
mour that would not bear con-&lt;br /&gt;
tradiction. However, as he knew&lt;br /&gt;
it would be fruitless to enter into&lt;br /&gt;
a downright quarrel, and yet he&lt;br /&gt;
could not live there in peace; he&lt;br /&gt;
had so much prudence as to quit the&lt;br /&gt;
house, which he did by getting out&lt;br /&gt;
of the window in the night. Not&lt;br /&gt;
liking to be out of employ, he went&lt;br /&gt;
to the house of NIC. FROG, (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:8&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:8&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;8&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;br /&gt;
his master’s old friend and rival, told&lt;br /&gt;
him the story of his sufferings, and&lt;br /&gt;
got leave to employ himself in one&lt;br /&gt;
of his garrets ‘till the storm should&lt;br /&gt;
be over. After he had been here&lt;br /&gt;
a while, he thought Nick’s family&lt;br /&gt;
were as much too loose in their man-&lt;br /&gt;
ners as Bull’s were too strict; and&lt;br /&gt;
having heard a rumour of the Forest,&lt;br /&gt;
to which Nick had some kind of&lt;br /&gt;
claim, he packed up his little all,&lt;br /&gt;
and hired one of Nick’s servants&lt;br /&gt;
who had been there a hunting, to&lt;br /&gt;
pilot him to that part of the Forest&lt;br /&gt;
to which Nick laid claim. But&lt;br /&gt;
Frog had laid an anchor to wind-&lt;br /&gt;
ward of him; for as Pickle had&lt;br /&gt;
said nothing to him about a lease,&lt;br /&gt;
he supposed that when Peregrine&lt;br /&gt;
had got into the Forest he would&lt;br /&gt;
take a lease of his old master, Bull,&lt;br /&gt;
which would strengthen his title,&lt;br /&gt;
and weaken his own; he therefore&lt;br /&gt;
bribed the pilot to shew Peregrine&lt;br /&gt;
to a barren part of the Forest instead&lt;br /&gt;
of that fertile place (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:9&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:9&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) to which he&lt;br /&gt;
had already sent his surveyors, and&lt;br /&gt;
of which he was contriving to get&lt;br /&gt;
possession. Accordingly the pilot&lt;br /&gt;
having conducted Pickle to a sandy&lt;br /&gt;
point which runs into the lake, (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:10&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:10&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
it being the dusk of the evening, (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:11&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:11&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;11&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) &lt;br /&gt;
bade him good night, and walked&lt;br /&gt;
off. Peregrine, who was fatigued&lt;br /&gt;
with his march, laid down and went&lt;br /&gt;
to sleep, but waking in the morning,&lt;br /&gt;
saw himself alone in a very dreary&lt;br /&gt;
situation, where he could get no-&lt;br /&gt;
thing to live upon but clams, and a&lt;br /&gt;
few acorns which the squirrels had&lt;br /&gt;
left. In this piteous plight the poor&lt;br /&gt;
fellow folded his arms, and walking&lt;br /&gt;
along the sandy beach, fell into such&lt;br /&gt;
a soliloquy as this. “So much for&lt;br /&gt;
travelling! Abused by Bull, cheat-&lt;br /&gt;
ed by Frog, what am I at last come&lt;br /&gt;
to? Here I am alone, no creatures&lt;br /&gt;
but bears, and wolves, and such&lt;br /&gt;
vermin around me! Nothing in the&lt;br /&gt;
shape of an human being that I&lt;br /&gt;
know of, nearer than Pipeweed’s&lt;br /&gt;
plantation, and with him I cannot&lt;br /&gt;
agree, he is so devoted to old Dame&lt;br /&gt;
Bull that he and I cannot live toge-&lt;br /&gt;
ther any more than I could with the&lt;br /&gt;
old woman. But, why should I&lt;br /&gt;
despair? That is unmanly; there&lt;br /&gt;
is at least a &lt;em&gt;possibility&lt;/em&gt; of my living&lt;br /&gt;
here, and if I am disappointed in&lt;br /&gt;
my worldly prospects, it is but&lt;br /&gt;
right, for I professed not to have&lt;br /&gt;
any. My wish was to have my&lt;br /&gt;
own way without disturbance or&lt;br /&gt;
contradiction, and surely I can here&lt;br /&gt;
enjoy my liberty. I have nobody&lt;br /&gt;
here to curse me, or kick me, or&lt;br /&gt;
cheat me. If I have only clams to&lt;br /&gt;
eat, I can cook them my own way,&lt;br /&gt;
and say as long a grace over them as&lt;br /&gt;
I please. I can sit or stand, or kneel,&lt;br /&gt;
or use any other posture at my de-&lt;br /&gt;
votions, without any cross old wo-&lt;br /&gt;
man to growl at me, or any hector-&lt;br /&gt;
ing bully to cuff me for it. So that&lt;br /&gt;
if I have lost in one way I have&lt;br /&gt;
gained in another. I had better&lt;br /&gt;
therefore reconcile myself to my si-&lt;br /&gt;
tuation and make the best of a bad&lt;br /&gt;
market. But company is good!&lt;br /&gt;
Apropos! I will write to some of&lt;br /&gt;
my fellow-prentices; I know they&lt;br /&gt;
were as discontented as myself in&lt;br /&gt;
old Bull’s family, though they did&lt;br /&gt;
not care to speak their minds as&lt;br /&gt;
plainly as I did. I’ll tell them how&lt;br /&gt;
much happiness I enjoy here in my&lt;br /&gt;
solitude. I’ll point out to them the&lt;br /&gt;
charms of liberty, and coax them&lt;br /&gt;
to follow me into the wilderness;&lt;br /&gt;
and by and by, when we get all to-&lt;br /&gt;
gether, we shall make a brave hand&lt;br /&gt;
of it.” Full of this resolution, he&lt;br /&gt;
sat down on a windfallen tree, and&lt;br /&gt;
pulling out his inkhorn and paper,&lt;br /&gt;
wrote a letter to JOHN CODLINE,&lt;br /&gt;
HUMPHRY PLOUGHSHARE, and&lt;br /&gt;
ROGER CARRIER, three of his fel-&lt;br /&gt;
low-apprentices, informing them of&lt;br /&gt;
the extreme happiness he enjoyed in&lt;br /&gt;
having liberty to eat his scanty meals&lt;br /&gt;
in his own way, and to lay his swell-&lt;br /&gt;
ed ancles and stiff knee in whatever&lt;br /&gt;
posture was most easy to him, con-&lt;br /&gt;
juring them by their former friend-&lt;br /&gt;
ship, to come to join them in car-&lt;br /&gt;
rying on the good work so happily&lt;br /&gt;
begun, &amp;amp;c. &amp;amp;c. As soon as he had&lt;br /&gt;
finished the letter, (which had deep-&lt;br /&gt;
ly engaged his attention) a hunts-&lt;br /&gt;
man happened to come along in&lt;br /&gt;
quest of game. This was a lucky&lt;br /&gt;
circumstance indeed, for Peregrine&lt;br /&gt;
had not once thought of a convey-&lt;br /&gt;
ance for his letter; it proved also&lt;br /&gt;
favourable to him in another view,&lt;br /&gt;
for the huntsman taking pity on his&lt;br /&gt;
forlorn situation, spared him some&lt;br /&gt;
powder and shot and a few biscuit&lt;br /&gt;
which he happened to have in his&lt;br /&gt;
pocket; so taking charge of the&lt;br /&gt;
letter, he delivered it as it was&lt;br /&gt;
directed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This letter arrived in good sea-&lt;br /&gt;
son, for Old Madam had grown&lt;br /&gt;
much worse since Pickle had left&lt;br /&gt;
the family : her vapours had in-&lt;br /&gt;
creased, and her longings and aver-&lt;br /&gt;
sions were much stronger. She had&lt;br /&gt;
a strange lurch for embroidered pet-&lt;br /&gt;
ticoats and high waving plumes;&lt;br /&gt;
her Christmas pies must have double&lt;br /&gt;
the quantity of spice that was us-&lt;br /&gt;
ual; the servants must make three&lt;br /&gt;
bows where they formerly made but&lt;br /&gt;
one, and they must never come into&lt;br /&gt;
her presence without having curled&lt;br /&gt;
and powdered their hair in the pink&lt;br /&gt;
of the mode, for she had an aversion&lt;br /&gt;
to every thing plain, and an high&lt;br /&gt;
relish for every thing gaudy. Be-&lt;br /&gt;
sides, she had retained an high met-&lt;br /&gt;
tled chaplain (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:12&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:12&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) who was constant-&lt;br /&gt;
ly at her elbow, and said prayers&lt;br /&gt;
night and morning in a brocaded&lt;br /&gt;
vest with a gilded mitre on his&lt;br /&gt;
head; and he exacted so many bows&lt;br /&gt;
and scrapes of every one in the fa-&lt;br /&gt;
mily, that it would have puzzled a&lt;br /&gt;
French dancing master to have kept&lt;br /&gt;
pace with him. Nor would he per-&lt;br /&gt;
form the service at all unless a ver-&lt;br /&gt;
ger stood by him all the while with&lt;br /&gt;
a yard-wand in his hand; and if&lt;br /&gt;
any servant or apprentice missed one&lt;br /&gt;
bow or scrape, or made it at the&lt;br /&gt;
wrong time, or dared to look off&lt;br /&gt;
his book, or said Amen in the wrong&lt;br /&gt;
place, rap went the stick over his&lt;br /&gt;
head and ears or nuckles. It was in&lt;br /&gt;
vain to appeal from the chaplain or&lt;br /&gt;
the old Dame to their master, for&lt;br /&gt;
he was so obedient a son that he&lt;br /&gt;
suffered them to govern him as they&lt;br /&gt;
pleased; nay, though broad hints&lt;br /&gt;
were given that the chaplain was an&lt;br /&gt;
emissary of lord Peter (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:13&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:13&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;13&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and was&lt;br /&gt;
taking advantage of the old lady’s&lt;br /&gt;
hysterics to bring the whole family&lt;br /&gt;
into his interest, John gave no heed&lt;br /&gt;
to any of these insinuations.&lt;br /&gt;
As soon as the letter of Pere-&lt;br /&gt;
grine Pickle arrived, the apprenti-&lt;br /&gt;
ces, to whom it was directed, held a&lt;br /&gt;
consultation what they should do.&lt;br /&gt;
They were heartily tired of the con-&lt;br /&gt;
duct of the chaplain; they lament-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the old lady’s ill health, and&lt;br /&gt;
wished for a cure; but there was at&lt;br /&gt;
present no hope of it, and there-&lt;br /&gt;
fore concluded that it was best to&lt;br /&gt;
follow Pickle’s advice, and retire&lt;br /&gt;
with him into the Forest. Though&lt;br /&gt;
they were infected with the spirit of&lt;br /&gt;
adventure, yet they were a set of&lt;br /&gt;
wary fellows, and knew they could&lt;br /&gt;
not with safety venture thither un-&lt;br /&gt;
less they had a lease of the land.&lt;br /&gt;
Happily, however, for them, Bull&lt;br /&gt;
had a little while before that put the&lt;br /&gt;
affairs of the Forest into the hands&lt;br /&gt;
of a gentleman of the law, (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:14&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:14&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;14&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) with&lt;br /&gt;
orders to see that the matter was&lt;br /&gt;
properly managed so as to yield him&lt;br /&gt;
some certain profit. To this sage&lt;br /&gt;
they applied, and for the proper&lt;br /&gt;
fees, which they clubbed for be-&lt;br /&gt;
tween them, they obtained a lease,&lt;br /&gt;
under hand and seal; wherein, for&lt;br /&gt;
“sundry causes him thereunto mov-&lt;br /&gt;
ing, the said Bull did grant and&lt;br /&gt;
convey unto John Codline and his&lt;br /&gt;
associates, so many acres of his Fo-&lt;br /&gt;
rest, bounded so and so, and which&lt;br /&gt;
they were to have, hold, and enjoy&lt;br /&gt;
for ever and ever and the day after,&lt;br /&gt;
yielding and paying so and so, and&lt;br /&gt;
so forth.” When this grand point&lt;br /&gt;
was gained by the assistance of the&lt;br /&gt;
lawyer and &lt;em&gt;his clerks&lt;/em&gt;, who knew&lt;br /&gt;
how to manage business: they sold&lt;br /&gt;
all their superfluities to the pawn-&lt;br /&gt;
brokers, and got together what&lt;br /&gt;
things they supposed they should&lt;br /&gt;
want, and leaving behind them a&lt;br /&gt;
note on the compter, (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:15&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:15&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;15&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) to tell their&lt;br /&gt;
master where they were bound and&lt;br /&gt;
what were their designs : they set&lt;br /&gt;
off all together and got safe into a&lt;br /&gt;
part of the Forest adjoining to&lt;br /&gt;
Pickle, who hearing of their arrival,&lt;br /&gt;
took his oaken staff in his hand and&lt;br /&gt;
hobbled along as fast as his lame&lt;br /&gt;
legs could carry him to see them, and&lt;br /&gt;
a joyful meeting indeed they had.&lt;br /&gt;
Having laid their heads together, it&lt;br /&gt;
was agreed that Codline should send&lt;br /&gt;
for a girl whom he had courted, (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:16&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:16&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;16&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
and marry her, and that he should&lt;br /&gt;
be considered as the lord of the&lt;br /&gt;
manor, that Pickle should have a&lt;br /&gt;
lease of that part which he had&lt;br /&gt;
pitched upon, and that Plough-&lt;br /&gt;
share and Carrier should for the pre-&lt;br /&gt;
sent be considered as members of&lt;br /&gt;
Codline’s family. John had taken&lt;br /&gt;
a great fancy to fishing, and thought&lt;br /&gt;
he could wholly or chiefly subsist by&lt;br /&gt;
it; but Humphry had a mind for a&lt;br /&gt;
farm; so after a while they parted&lt;br /&gt;
in friendship. Humphry, with a&lt;br /&gt;
pack on his back and a spade in his&lt;br /&gt;
hand, travelled across the Forest ‘till&lt;br /&gt;
he found a wide meadow with a&lt;br /&gt;
large brook (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:17&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:17&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;17&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) running through it,&lt;br /&gt;
which he supposed to be within&lt;br /&gt;
John’s grant, and intended still to&lt;br /&gt;
consider himself as a distant member&lt;br /&gt;
of the family. But as it fell out&lt;br /&gt;
otherwise, he was obliged to get a&lt;br /&gt;
new lease, to which Mr. Frog made&lt;br /&gt;
some objections, but they were over-&lt;br /&gt;
ruled; and soon after another old&lt;br /&gt;
fellow-servant, TOBIAS WHEATER,&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:18&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:18&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;18&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) came and sat down by him.&lt;br /&gt;
They being so much alike in their&lt;br /&gt;
views and dispositions, agreed to&lt;br /&gt;
live together as intimates, though&lt;br /&gt;
in two families, which they did ‘till&lt;br /&gt;
Wheater’s death, when Plough-&lt;br /&gt;
share became his sole heir, and the&lt;br /&gt;
estate has ever since been his. This&lt;br /&gt;
Humphry was always a very indus-&lt;br /&gt;
trious, frugal, saving husband; and&lt;br /&gt;
his wife, though a formal strait-&lt;br /&gt;
laced sort of a body, yet always&lt;br /&gt;
minded her spinning and knitting,&lt;br /&gt;
and took excellent care of her&lt;br /&gt;
dairy. She always clothed her&lt;br /&gt;
children in homespun garments,&lt;br /&gt;
and scarcely ever spent a farthing&lt;br /&gt;
for outlandish trinkets. The fa-&lt;br /&gt;
mily and all its concerns were&lt;br /&gt;
under very exact regulations: not&lt;br /&gt;
one of them was suffered to peep out&lt;br /&gt;
of doors after the sun was set. It&lt;br /&gt;
was never allowed to brew on Sa-&lt;br /&gt;
turday, lest the beer should break&lt;br /&gt;
the Fourth Commandment by work-&lt;br /&gt;
ing on Sunday: and once it is said&lt;br /&gt;
the stallion was impounded a&lt;br /&gt;
whole week for having held &lt;em&gt;crim. *&lt;br /&gt;
*con.&lt;/em&gt; with the mare while the Old&lt;br /&gt;
Gentleman was at his devotions.&lt;br /&gt;
Bating these peculiarities, (and eve-&lt;br /&gt;
ry body has some) Humphry was a&lt;br /&gt;
very good sort of man, a kind neigh-&lt;br /&gt;
bor, very thriving, and made a&lt;br /&gt;
respectable figure, though he lived&lt;br /&gt;
a retired life and did not much fol-&lt;br /&gt;
low the fashions, yet he raised a&lt;br /&gt;
good estate, and brought up a large&lt;br /&gt;
family, who knew how to get their&lt;br /&gt;
living wherever they could find land.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;To be continued.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[3. August 1787]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FORESTERS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An&lt;/em&gt; AMERICAN TALE, &lt;em&gt;being a Sequel to the History of&lt;/em&gt; JOHN BULL, &lt;em&gt;the
Clothier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Continued from Page 517.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AFTER Ploughshare’s depar-&lt;br /&gt;
ture, John Codline with his&lt;br /&gt;
family kept on their fishing and&lt;br /&gt;
planting, and sometimes went a&lt;br /&gt;
hunting, so that they made out to&lt;br /&gt;
get a tolerable subsistence. John’s&lt;br /&gt;
family grew, and he settled his sons&lt;br /&gt;
as fast as they became of age, to live&lt;br /&gt;
by themselves; and when any of&lt;br /&gt;
his old acquaintance came to see&lt;br /&gt;
him, he bade them welcome, and&lt;br /&gt;
was their very good friend, &lt;em&gt;as long *&lt;br /&gt;
*as they continued to be of his mind&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
and no longer; for he was a very&lt;br /&gt;
pragmatical sort of a fellow, and&lt;br /&gt;
loved to have his own way in every&lt;br /&gt;
thing. This was the cause of a&lt;br /&gt;
quarrel between him and &lt;em&gt;Roger *&lt;br /&gt;
*Carrier&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:19&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:19&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), for it happened that&lt;br /&gt;
Roger had taken a fancy to dip his&lt;br /&gt;
head into (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:20&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:20&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;20&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) water, as the most&lt;br /&gt;
effectual way of washing his face,&lt;br /&gt;
and thought it could not be made so&lt;br /&gt;
clean in any other way. John, who&lt;br /&gt;
used the common way of taking&lt;br /&gt;
water in his hand, to wash his face,&lt;br /&gt;
was displeased with Roger’s innova-&lt;br /&gt;
tion, and remonstrated against it.&lt;br /&gt;
The remonstrance had no other ef-&lt;br /&gt;
fect, than to fix Roger’s opinion&lt;br /&gt;
more firmly, and as a farther im-&lt;br /&gt;
provement on his new plan, he pre-&lt;br /&gt;
tended that no person ought to have&lt;br /&gt;
his face washed till he was capable&lt;br /&gt;
of doing it himself, without any as-&lt;br /&gt;
sistance from his parents. John was&lt;br /&gt;
out of patience with this addition,&lt;br /&gt;
and plumply told him, that if he&lt;br /&gt;
did not reform his principles and&lt;br /&gt;
practice, he would fine him, or flog&lt;br /&gt;
him, or kick him out of doors. These&lt;br /&gt;
threats put Roger on inventing&lt;br /&gt;
other odd and whimsical opinions.&lt;br /&gt;
He took offence at the letter X, and&lt;br /&gt;
would have had it expunged from&lt;br /&gt;
the alphabet. (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:21&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:21&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;21&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) He would not&lt;br /&gt;
do his duty at a military muster,&lt;br /&gt;
because there was an X in the co-&lt;br /&gt;
lours. After a while he began to&lt;br /&gt;
scruple the lawfulness of bearing&lt;br /&gt;
arms, and killing wild beasts. But,&lt;br /&gt;
poor fellow! the worst of all was,&lt;br /&gt;
that being seized with a shaking&lt;br /&gt;
palsy (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:22&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:22&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;22&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), which affected every limb&lt;br /&gt;
and joint of him; his speech was so&lt;br /&gt;
altered that he was unable to pro-&lt;br /&gt;
nounce certain letters and syllables&lt;br /&gt;
as he had been used to do. These&lt;br /&gt;
oddities and defects rendered him&lt;br /&gt;
more and more disagreeable to his&lt;br /&gt;
old friend, who, however, kept his&lt;br /&gt;
temper as well as he could, till one&lt;br /&gt;
day, as John was saying a long grace&lt;br /&gt;
over his meat, Roger kept his hat&lt;br /&gt;
on the whole time. As soon as the&lt;br /&gt;
ceremony was over, John took up a&lt;br /&gt;
case knife from the table, and gave&lt;br /&gt;
Roger a blow on the ear with the&lt;br /&gt;
broad side of it, then with a rising&lt;br /&gt;
stroke turned off his hat. Roger said&lt;br /&gt;
nothing, but taking up his hat put&lt;br /&gt;
it on again; at which John broke&lt;br /&gt;
out into such a passionate speech as&lt;br /&gt;
this “You impudent scoundrel! is&lt;br /&gt;
it come to this! Have I not borne&lt;br /&gt;
with your whims and fidgets these&lt;br /&gt;
many years, and yet they grow up-&lt;br /&gt;
on you? Have I not talked with&lt;br /&gt;
you time after time, and proved to&lt;br /&gt;
you as plain as the nose in your face&lt;br /&gt;
that your notions are wrong? Have&lt;br /&gt;
I not ordered you to leave them off,&lt;br /&gt;
and warned you of the consequence,&lt;br /&gt;
and yet you have gone on from bad&lt;br /&gt;
to worse. You began with dipping&lt;br /&gt;
your head into water, and would&lt;br /&gt;
have all the family do the same, pre-&lt;br /&gt;
tending there was no other way of&lt;br /&gt;
washing the face. You would have&lt;br /&gt;
had the children go dirty all their&lt;br /&gt;
days, under pretence that they were&lt;br /&gt;
not able to wash their own faces, and&lt;br /&gt;
so they must have looked like the pigs&lt;br /&gt;
till they were grown up. Then you&lt;br /&gt;
would talk your own balderdash&lt;br /&gt;
linguo, [sic] &lt;em&gt;thee and thou, and nan&lt;/em&gt;–&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;forsooth&lt;/em&gt;–and now you must keep&lt;br /&gt;
your hat on when I am at my devo-&lt;br /&gt;
tions, and I suppose would be glad&lt;br /&gt;
to have the whole family do the&lt;br /&gt;
same! There is no bearing with&lt;br /&gt;
you any longer–so now–hear me,&lt;br /&gt;
I give you fair warning, if you don’t&lt;br /&gt;
mend your manners, and retract your&lt;br /&gt;
errors, and promise reformation, I’ll&lt;br /&gt;
kick you out of the house. I’d&lt;br /&gt;
have no such refractory fellows here,&lt;br /&gt;
I came into this forest for &lt;em&gt;reforma- *&lt;br /&gt;
*tion&lt;/em&gt;, and reformation I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have.”&lt;br /&gt;
“Friend John (said Roger) dost&lt;br /&gt;
not thou remember when thou and&lt;br /&gt;
I lived together in friend Bull’s fa-&lt;br /&gt;
mily, how hard thou didst think it&lt;br /&gt;
to be compelled to look on thy book&lt;br /&gt;
all the time that the hooded chap-&lt;br /&gt;
lain was reading the prayers, and&lt;br /&gt;
how many knocks and thumps thou&lt;br /&gt;
and I had for offering to use our li-&lt;br /&gt;
berty, which we thought we had a&lt;br /&gt;
right to? Didst thou not come hi-&lt;br /&gt;
therunto for the sake of enjoying&lt;br /&gt;
thy liberty, and did not I come to&lt;br /&gt;
enjoy mine? Wherefore then dost&lt;br /&gt;
thou assume to deprive me of the&lt;br /&gt;
right which thou claimest for thy-&lt;br /&gt;
self?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Don’t tell me (answered John)&lt;br /&gt;
of right and of liberty–you have&lt;br /&gt;
as much liberty as any man ought&lt;br /&gt;
to have. You have liberty to do&lt;br /&gt;
right, and no man ought to have&lt;br /&gt;
liberty to do wrong.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who is to be judge (replied&lt;br /&gt;
Roger) what is right or what is&lt;br /&gt;
wrong? Ought not I to judge for&lt;br /&gt;
myself? or thinkest thou it is thy&lt;br /&gt;
place to judge for me?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Who is to be judge (said John)&lt;br /&gt;
why &lt;em&gt;the book&lt;/em&gt; is to be judge–and I&lt;br /&gt;
have proved by the book over and&lt;br /&gt;
over again that you are wrong, and&lt;br /&gt;
therefore you are wrong, and you&lt;br /&gt;
have no liberty to do any thing but&lt;br /&gt;
what is right.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“But friend John (said Roger)&lt;br /&gt;
who is to judge whether thou hast&lt;br /&gt;
proved my opinions or conduct to&lt;br /&gt;
be wrong–thou or I? [sic]&lt;br /&gt;
“Come, come, (said John) not so&lt;br /&gt;
close neither–none of your idle dis-&lt;br /&gt;
tinctions, I &lt;em&gt;say&lt;/em&gt; you are in the wrong,&lt;br /&gt;
I have &lt;em&gt;proved&lt;/em&gt; it, and &lt;em&gt;you know&lt;/em&gt; it,&lt;br /&gt;
you have sinned against &lt;em&gt;your own *&lt;br /&gt;
*conscience&lt;/em&gt;, and therefore you deserve&lt;br /&gt;
to be cut off as an incorrigible he-&lt;br /&gt;
retic.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“How dost thou know (said&lt;br /&gt;
Roger) that I have sinned against&lt;br /&gt;
my own conscience? Canst thou&lt;br /&gt;
search the heart?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this John was so enraged that&lt;br /&gt;
he gave him a smart kick on the&lt;br /&gt;
posteriors, and bade him be gone out&lt;br /&gt;
of his house, and off his lands, and&lt;br /&gt;
called after him to tell him, that if&lt;br /&gt;
ever he should catch him there again&lt;br /&gt;
he would knock his brains out. Ro-&lt;br /&gt;
ger having experienced that the lo-&lt;br /&gt;
gic of the foot, applied to the breech&lt;br /&gt;
is the most powerful of arguments,&lt;br /&gt;
walked off; but had so much of hu-&lt;br /&gt;
man nature left in him, as to turn up&lt;br /&gt;
the folds of his coat, and expose the&lt;br /&gt;
insulted part to view, which action,&lt;br /&gt;
however expressive, has always been&lt;br /&gt;
deemed no swearing, nor breach of&lt;br /&gt;
the peace.–Thus they parted, and&lt;br /&gt;
Roger having travelled as far as he&lt;br /&gt;
supposed to be out of the limits of&lt;br /&gt;
John’s lease, laid himself down by&lt;br /&gt;
the side of a clear rivulet, which&lt;br /&gt;
flowed down a hill; here he com-&lt;br /&gt;
posed himself to sleep, and on his&lt;br /&gt;
awaking found several bears about&lt;br /&gt;
him, but none offered him any in-&lt;br /&gt;
sult. Upon which he said, and mi-&lt;br /&gt;
nuted it down in his pocket book,&lt;br /&gt;
“Surely the beasts of the wilder-&lt;br /&gt;
ness are in friendship with me, and&lt;br /&gt;
this is designed by &lt;em&gt;Providence&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;sup id=&quot;fnref:23&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#fn:23&quot; class=&quot;footnote&quot;&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) as&lt;br /&gt;
my resting place; here, therefore,&lt;br /&gt;
will I pitch my tabernacle, and here&lt;br /&gt;
shall I dwell more in peace, though&lt;br /&gt;
surrounded by bears and wolves, than&lt;br /&gt;
when in the midst of those whom I&lt;br /&gt;
counted my brethren.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On this spot he built an hut, and&lt;br /&gt;
having taken possession, made a visit&lt;br /&gt;
to his old master Bull, who gave&lt;br /&gt;
him a lease of the place, with an&lt;br /&gt;
island or two in an adjoining cove of&lt;br /&gt;
the great lake, and recommended&lt;br /&gt;
to him a wife, by whom he had a&lt;br /&gt;
few children; but his plantation was&lt;br /&gt;
chiefly increased by the flocking of&lt;br /&gt;
strangers to him; for he was a ve-&lt;br /&gt;
ry hospitable man, and made it a&lt;br /&gt;
rule in his family not to refuse any&lt;br /&gt;
who should come, whether lame or&lt;br /&gt;
blind, short or tall, whether they&lt;br /&gt;
had two eyes or one, whether they s&lt;br /&gt;
quinted or stammered, or limped, or&lt;br /&gt;
had any other natural defect or im-&lt;br /&gt;
pediment; it was another rule that&lt;br /&gt;
every one should bear with the in-&lt;br /&gt;
firmities of his neighbours, and help&lt;br /&gt;
one another as they were able. I&lt;br /&gt;
remember once as I was passing&lt;br /&gt;
through Roger’s plantation I saw&lt;br /&gt;
one man carrying another on his&lt;br /&gt;
shoulders, which, at first, I thought&lt;br /&gt;
a very odd sight; upon coming up&lt;br /&gt;
to them, I perceived that the lower&lt;br /&gt;
one was blind, and the upper one&lt;br /&gt;
was lame, so as they had but one&lt;br /&gt;
pair of eyes, and one pair of legs&lt;br /&gt;
between them; the lame man avail-&lt;br /&gt;
ed himself of the blind man’s legs,&lt;br /&gt;
and he of the other’s eyes, and both&lt;br /&gt;
went along very well together. I&lt;br /&gt;
remember also, that as I passed along,&lt;br /&gt;
the fences were in some places made&lt;br /&gt;
of very crooked, knotty rails; but&lt;br /&gt;
the crooks and knots were made to&lt;br /&gt;
say [sic] into each other so cleverly, that&lt;br /&gt;
the fences were as tight as if they&lt;br /&gt;
had been made of stuff sawed ever so&lt;br /&gt;
even; a circumstance which con-&lt;br /&gt;
vinced me that very crooked things&lt;br /&gt;
might be put together, to advan-&lt;br /&gt;
tage, if proper pains were taken&lt;br /&gt;
about it. This, however, was some&lt;br /&gt;
time ago.–i have sine heard that&lt;br /&gt;
the old crooks and knots and got&lt;br /&gt;
out of order, and that they have not&lt;br /&gt;
the art of making new ones say into&lt;br /&gt;
one another so well as formerly.&lt;br /&gt;
Whenever this happens it affords a&lt;br /&gt;
kind of burlesque on the art of fence-&lt;br /&gt;
making, but alas! how can it be&lt;br /&gt;
otherwise when not but the lame&lt;br /&gt;
and the blind are employed in the work?&lt;br /&gt;
When John Codline had settled&lt;br /&gt;
the controversy with Roger by kick-&lt;br /&gt;
ing him out of doors, he began to&lt;br /&gt;
look about him to see what his neigh-&lt;br /&gt;
bours were doing. Having found a&lt;br /&gt;
young fellow on his north-eastern&lt;br /&gt;
limits, who had come thither with-&lt;br /&gt;
out his knowledge or permission;&lt;br /&gt;
he took it into his head to survey&lt;br /&gt;
the extent of his grounds. The&lt;br /&gt;
words of his lease were rather am-&lt;br /&gt;
biguous, and by virtue thereof he&lt;br /&gt;
thought it convenient to extend his&lt;br /&gt;
claims over the lands on which &lt;em&gt;Ro- *&lt;br /&gt;
*bert Lumber&lt;/em&gt; (for that was the name&lt;br /&gt;
of the young fellow) had settled.&lt;br /&gt;
([^24]) It seems that Bob had been sent&lt;br /&gt;
by some of John Bull’s family to&lt;br /&gt;
erect a fishing stage on the borders&lt;br /&gt;
of the Lake, and the lawyer who&lt;br /&gt;
had the care of the forest not being&lt;br /&gt;
acquainted so much as he ought to&lt;br /&gt;
have been with the situation of the&lt;br /&gt;
lands, or having no knowledge of the&lt;br /&gt;
art of surveying, had made out a&lt;br /&gt;
lease which lapped over Codline’s; so&lt;br /&gt;
that each of them had a claim upon&lt;br /&gt;
it. In some circumstances this might&lt;br /&gt;
have been deemed unfortunate, but&lt;br /&gt;
as it happened it proved lucky for&lt;br /&gt;
poor Bob–his employers had left&lt;br /&gt;
him in the lurch, and he would have&lt;br /&gt;
starved to death if John had not&lt;br /&gt;
taken him under his wing and sent&lt;br /&gt;
him provisions to keep him alive.&lt;br /&gt;
He also lent him a hand to clear up&lt;br /&gt;
the bushes, and furnished him with&lt;br /&gt;
materials to build a saw-mill. This&lt;br /&gt;
set Bob on his own legs, and he&lt;br /&gt;
proved a sturdy faithful fellow. He&lt;br /&gt;
was of great service to John in kill-&lt;br /&gt;
ing bears and wolves that infested&lt;br /&gt;
his plantation; and when he himself&lt;br /&gt;
was in danger, John lent him pow-&lt;br /&gt;
der, shot, and flints, and sent hands&lt;br /&gt;
to help him, and in so doing he serv-&lt;br /&gt;
ed himself as well as his neighbour,&lt;br /&gt;
which was no breach of morality.&lt;br /&gt;
Thus they lived pretty peaceably to-&lt;br /&gt;
gether, till after a while Bob’s old&lt;br /&gt;
owners found the land was grown&lt;br /&gt;
good for something, and then (with-&lt;br /&gt;
out paying John for his assistance&lt;br /&gt;
in making it so) appealed to Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Bull, and got it away, and took a&lt;br /&gt;
large slice of John’s land into the&lt;br /&gt;
bargain. ([^25]) This was a matter&lt;br /&gt;
which stuck in John’s throat a great&lt;br /&gt;
while, and if I am rightly informed&lt;br /&gt;
he has hardly swallowed it yet.&lt;br /&gt;
He did not think himself fairly dealt&lt;br /&gt;
by though he had all Peregrine&lt;br /&gt;
Pickle’s land put into a new lease&lt;br /&gt;
which Bull gave him. To be short,&lt;br /&gt;
John Codline and John Bull never&lt;br /&gt;
heartily loved one another; they&lt;br /&gt;
were in their temper and disposition&lt;br /&gt;
too much alike; each was eternally&lt;br /&gt;
jealous of the other: Business was,&lt;br /&gt;
indeed, carried on pretty well be-&lt;br /&gt;
tween them for many years, and had&lt;br /&gt;
Mr Bull hearkened to the advice of&lt;br /&gt;
his best friends, I suppose there&lt;br /&gt;
would never have been any open&lt;br /&gt;
quarrel between them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;To be continued.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[4. September 1787]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FORESTERS,\
&lt;em&gt;An&lt;/em&gt; AMERICAN TALE, &lt;em&gt;being a Sequel to the History of&lt;/em&gt; JOHN BULL, &lt;em&gt;the
Clothier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Continued from Page&lt;/em&gt; 568.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BETWEEN the lands occupied&lt;br /&gt;
by Frederick Marygold, and&lt;br /&gt;
those on which Humpry Plough-&lt;br /&gt;
share had made his settlement, was&lt;br /&gt;
a large tract of waste, where none&lt;br /&gt;
of Mr. Bull’s family had ever been;&lt;br /&gt;
but the report of the plantations&lt;br /&gt;
which one and another of them had&lt;br /&gt;
made, drew the attention of Bull’s&lt;br /&gt;
neighbours. Among these, &lt;em&gt;Nicolas *&lt;br /&gt;
*Frog&lt;/em&gt; ([^26]) was not an idle spectator.&lt;br /&gt;
He was as sly a fellow as you will&lt;br /&gt;
meet with in a summer’s day, always&lt;br /&gt;
attentive to his interest, and never&lt;br /&gt;
let slip an opportunity to promote&lt;br /&gt;
it. Observing that Mr. Bull was&lt;br /&gt;
rather careless of the Forest, and trust-&lt;br /&gt;
ed his lawyers and servants with the&lt;br /&gt;
management of it, and knowing&lt;br /&gt;
there was a large slice of it unoccu-&lt;br /&gt;
pied, he clandestinely sent out some&lt;br /&gt;
surveyors in the disguise of hunters,&lt;br /&gt;
to make a description of the coun-&lt;br /&gt;
try, and report to him at their re-&lt;br /&gt;
turn. Another good neighbor&lt;br /&gt;
GUSTAVUS, the ironmonger ([^27])&lt;br /&gt;
was gaping after it, and gave out word&lt;br /&gt;
among his journeymen, that if any&lt;br /&gt;
of them would adventure thither&lt;br /&gt;
and set up their trade, he would up-&lt;br /&gt;
hold them in their pretensions, and&lt;br /&gt;
lend them any assistance in his pow-&lt;br /&gt;
er. Accordingly one of them, by the&lt;br /&gt;
name of &lt;em&gt;Casimir&lt;/em&gt;, ventured to make&lt;br /&gt;
a beginning on the shore of a navi-&lt;br /&gt;
gable creek; ([^28]) but did not care&lt;br /&gt;
to penetrate far into the country,&lt;br /&gt;
on account of the wolves and bears,&lt;br /&gt;
which were very numerous thereabouts.&lt;br /&gt;
As soon as Frog heard of this he&lt;br /&gt;
picked a quarrel with Gustavus, and&lt;br /&gt;
insisted that the land was his by&lt;br /&gt;
possession, because he had already&lt;br /&gt;
sent surveyors thither. It happened&lt;br /&gt;
however, that the place which Frog’s&lt;br /&gt;
people had pitched upon was at the&lt;br /&gt;
mouth of another creek, ([^29]) at a&lt;br /&gt;
considerable distance; where they&lt;br /&gt;
had built a hut, on a point of land,&lt;br /&gt;
and farther up the creek they had&lt;br /&gt;
erected a kind of lodge or hunting-&lt;br /&gt;
house, ([^30]) for the convenience of&lt;br /&gt;
collecting game. On this planta-&lt;br /&gt;
tion Frog had placed PETER STI-&lt;br /&gt;
VER, a one-legged fellow, as his&lt;br /&gt;
overseer. As soon as Peter heard&lt;br /&gt;
of the quarrel between his master&lt;br /&gt;
and Gustavus, he thought the quick-&lt;br /&gt;
est way of ending it was the best;&lt;br /&gt;
and therefore, without waiting for&lt;br /&gt;
orders or ceremony, he went and&lt;br /&gt;
commanded Casimir off the ground;&lt;br /&gt;
and with one of his crutches beat&lt;br /&gt;
his house to pieces about his ears.&lt;br /&gt;
The poor fellow stared at this rough&lt;br /&gt;
treatment; but was glad to escape&lt;br /&gt;
with whole bones, and humbly re-&lt;br /&gt;
quested leave to remain there with&lt;br /&gt;
his tools, promising to follow his&lt;br /&gt;
business quietly, and become an ob-&lt;br /&gt;
edient servant to Mr. Frog; upon&lt;br /&gt;
these conditions he was permitted&lt;br /&gt;
to remain, and the whole tract was&lt;br /&gt;
reputed Frog’s property.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While these things were doing&lt;br /&gt;
John Bull was confined to his house&lt;br /&gt;
with a violent fever and delirium ([^31]),&lt;br /&gt;
under which he laboured for a long&lt;br /&gt;
time, and his imagination was the&lt;br /&gt;
seat of every wild freak and strange&lt;br /&gt;
vagary. One while he fancied&lt;br /&gt;
himself an absolute monarch, then,&lt;br /&gt;
a presbyterian clergyman, then a&lt;br /&gt;
general of horse, then a lord-pro-&lt;br /&gt;
tector; his noddle was filled with a&lt;br /&gt;
jumble of polemic divinity, political&lt;br /&gt;
disputes, and military arrangements,&lt;br /&gt;
and it was not till after much blood-&lt;br /&gt;
letting, blistering, vomiting and&lt;br /&gt;
purging, that he began to mend.&lt;br /&gt;
Under this severe, but wholesome&lt;br /&gt;
regimen, he at length grew cool and&lt;br /&gt;
came to himself, but found on his&lt;br /&gt;
recovery that his affairs had gone&lt;br /&gt;
behind-hand during his sickness.&lt;br /&gt;
Beside the loss of business, he had&lt;br /&gt;
physicians and apothecaries bills to&lt;br /&gt;
pay, and those who had attended&lt;br /&gt;
upon him as nurses, watchers, por-&lt;br /&gt;
ters, &amp;amp;c. all expected wages or dou-&lt;br /&gt;
ceurs, and were continually haunt-&lt;br /&gt;
ing him with, How does your honour&lt;br /&gt;
do? I am glad to see your honour so&lt;br /&gt;
well as to be abroad. Some one or&lt;br /&gt;
more were continually putting&lt;br /&gt;
themselves in his way, and if they&lt;br /&gt;
did not directly &lt;em&gt;dun&lt;/em&gt; him for pay-&lt;br /&gt;
ment, their looks were so signify-&lt;br /&gt;
cant that a man of less penetration&lt;br /&gt;
could easily have guessed what was&lt;br /&gt;
their meaning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bull was somewhat perplexed&lt;br /&gt;
how to answer all their demands&lt;br /&gt;
and expectations. He was too far&lt;br /&gt;
behind-hand to be able to satisfy&lt;br /&gt;
them, and withal too generous to&lt;br /&gt;
let them remain unpaid. At length&lt;br /&gt;
he hit on this expedient: “These&lt;br /&gt;
fellows (said he to himself) have&lt;br /&gt;
served me well, and may be of use&lt;br /&gt;
to me again. There is yet a con-&lt;br /&gt;
siderable part of my forest unoccu-&lt;br /&gt;
pied. I’ll offer to lease them tracts&lt;br /&gt;
of land which &lt;em&gt;cost me nothing&lt;/em&gt;, and&lt;br /&gt;
if they will accept them at a low&lt;br /&gt;
rent, they may prove useful ser-&lt;br /&gt;
vants, and I shall be a gainer as well&lt;br /&gt;
as they.” Having come to this&lt;br /&gt;
resolution, he began to enquire&lt;br /&gt;
into the affairs of his forest, and found&lt;br /&gt;
that his neighbours had intruded&lt;br /&gt;
upon his claim. LEWIS had taken&lt;br /&gt;
possession at one end ([^32]); Lord&lt;br /&gt;
STRUT at the ([^33]) other; and NIC&lt;br /&gt;
FROG in the middle ([^34]), and his&lt;br /&gt;
own tenants had been quarrelling&lt;br /&gt;
with their new neighbours, as well&lt;br /&gt;
as among themselves. “Hey day,&lt;br /&gt;
(says John) this will never do; I&lt;br /&gt;
must keep a good look out upon&lt;br /&gt;
these dogs, or they will get the ad-&lt;br /&gt;
vantage of me.” Away he goes to&lt;br /&gt;
Frog, and begun to complain of the&lt;br /&gt;
ill treatment which he had received.&lt;br /&gt;
Frog who had no mind either to&lt;br /&gt;
quarrel, or to cry peccavi, like a&lt;br /&gt;
sly, evasive whore-son as he was,&lt;br /&gt;
shrugged up his shoulders, disowned&lt;br /&gt;
what his servants had done, and said,&lt;br /&gt;
he supposed they only meant to kill&lt;br /&gt;
game, and did not intend to hold&lt;br /&gt;
possession. Bull was not to be put&lt;br /&gt;
off so; his blood was up and he de-&lt;br /&gt;
termined to treat Frog’s servants&lt;br /&gt;
as they had treated Casimir. So, cal-&lt;br /&gt;
ling a trusty old stud out of his&lt;br /&gt;
compting house, “Here Bob ([^35])&lt;br /&gt;
(said he) take one of my servants&lt;br /&gt;
with a couple of blood hounds, and&lt;br /&gt;
go to that part of the forest where&lt;br /&gt;
Peter Stiver has encroached, give&lt;br /&gt;
him fair warning; tell him the land&lt;br /&gt;
is mine, and I will have it; if he&lt;br /&gt;
gives up at once, treat him well and&lt;br /&gt;
tell him I’ll give him leave to re-&lt;br /&gt;
main there; but if he offers to make&lt;br /&gt;
any resistance, or hesitates about an&lt;br /&gt;
answer, set your dogs at him and&lt;br /&gt;
drive him off; kill his cattle and set&lt;br /&gt;
his house on fire; never fear, I’ll&lt;br /&gt;
bear you out in it.” Away goes&lt;br /&gt;
Bob and delivered his message; Pe-&lt;br /&gt;
ter at first thought it a matter of&lt;br /&gt;
amusement, and begun to divert&lt;br /&gt;
himself with it; but as soon as the&lt;br /&gt;
dogs opened upon him he found his&lt;br /&gt;
mistake, and rather than run the&lt;br /&gt;
risk of being driven off, he quietly&lt;br /&gt;
submitted to the conditions proposed.&lt;br /&gt;
“Hang it (said he to himself)&lt;br /&gt;
what care I who is my landlord?&lt;br /&gt;
Gain is my object, I have already&lt;br /&gt;
been at great expense, and have a&lt;br /&gt;
prospect of getting an estate, to re-&lt;br /&gt;
move will ruin me, I’ll therefore&lt;br /&gt;
stay here, and make money under&lt;br /&gt;
Bull, or Frog, or any other master&lt;br /&gt;
that will let me stay.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a subsequent quarrel which&lt;br /&gt;
happened between Bull and Frog–&lt;br /&gt;
the latter seized upon this planta-&lt;br /&gt;
tion again, and Peter recognized&lt;br /&gt;
his old master; but upon a com-&lt;br /&gt;
promise it was given up to Bull in&lt;br /&gt;
exchange for a tract of swamp ([^36])&lt;br /&gt;
which lay far to the southward.&lt;br /&gt;
Peter continued on the ground&lt;br /&gt;
through all these changes, and follow-&lt;br /&gt;
ed his business with great diligence,&lt;br /&gt;
collecting game and pelts, and ven-&lt;br /&gt;
ding them sometimes to Mr. Bull,&lt;br /&gt;
and sometimes to Mr. Frog. How-&lt;br /&gt;
ever, Bull thought it best that, in&lt;br /&gt;
token of subjection, Stiver should&lt;br /&gt;
change his name; to which he con-&lt;br /&gt;
sented, and partly to please his new&lt;br /&gt;
master, and partly to retain the re-&lt;br /&gt;
membrance of his old one, he assum-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the name of BULL FROG.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The whole tract which was thus&lt;br /&gt;
gotten from Frog, was thought too&lt;br /&gt;
large for one plantation, and there-&lt;br /&gt;
fore Mr. Bull, in pursuance of the&lt;br /&gt;
plan which he had formed appro-&lt;br /&gt;
priated the rents of the plantation,&lt;br /&gt;
on which Bull Frog was seated to&lt;br /&gt;
his brother, and the other part&lt;br /&gt;
which had been taken from Casimir&lt;br /&gt;
was leafed to two of his servants,&lt;br /&gt;
CART-RUT and BARE-CLAY, and&lt;br /&gt;
sometime after another tract was&lt;br /&gt;
set off to WILLIAM BROADBRIM,&lt;br /&gt;
whose father had been an assiduous&lt;br /&gt;
rat-catcher in Mr. Bull’s family;&lt;br /&gt;
but more of this hereafter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cart-rut&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Bare-clay&lt;/em&gt; agreed&lt;br /&gt;
to divide their land into two farms,&lt;br /&gt;
which they called the east and west&lt;br /&gt;
farms; ([^37]) but when they came to&lt;br /&gt;
run the division line, their compasses&lt;br /&gt;
differed so much that they could&lt;br /&gt;
not fix the boundary. This was&lt;br /&gt;
one cause of dissention. Another&lt;br /&gt;
was the different humors and dispo-&lt;br /&gt;
sitions of their families. Those on&lt;br /&gt;
the East farm were brought up un-&lt;br /&gt;
der Mr. Bull’s sister PEG ([^38]); and&lt;br /&gt;
as it is well known that she and her&lt;br /&gt;
brother had long been at variance,&lt;br /&gt;
so their domestics had got tinctured&lt;br /&gt;
with the notions and prejudices of&lt;br /&gt;
their respective families. The fa-&lt;br /&gt;
mily on the West farm was made up&lt;br /&gt;
of persons who were subject to the&lt;br /&gt;
epidemic ague or shaking palsy ([^39]);&lt;br /&gt;
with some stragglers from Bull-&lt;br /&gt;
frog’s and Casimir’s families. From&lt;br /&gt;
this diversity of constitutions and&lt;br /&gt;
humours arose bickerings and quar-&lt;br /&gt;
rels, a disinclination to work&lt;br /&gt;
and submit to family government.&lt;br /&gt;
These disorders continued a long&lt;br /&gt;
while, and business went on very&lt;br /&gt;
slowly, till at length the heads of&lt;br /&gt;
both families agreed to give up their&lt;br /&gt;
separate leases, and take a new one&lt;br /&gt;
of the whole, and let Mr. Bull appoint&lt;br /&gt;
an overseer. By these means peace&lt;br /&gt;
was restored, and the new overseer,&lt;br /&gt;
who was supposed to be a descen-&lt;br /&gt;
dant of JULIUS CæSAR, gave the&lt;br /&gt;
name of his ancestor to the farm,&lt;br /&gt;
which has ever since been called Cæ-&lt;br /&gt;
SAREA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was another large portion&lt;br /&gt;
of the forest, which lay southward&lt;br /&gt;
of Walter Pipe-weed’s plantation,&lt;br /&gt;
and which no person had yet taken&lt;br /&gt;
up, though some had made attempts&lt;br /&gt;
and had been driven off by the num-&lt;br /&gt;
berless musquitoes and sand-flies,&lt;br /&gt;
which abounded in those places.&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Bull was still desirous to re-&lt;br /&gt;
ward his friends in the &lt;em&gt;cheapest man- *&lt;br /&gt;
*ner&lt;/em&gt;, and at the same time to keep&lt;br /&gt;
his neighbors from encroaching&lt;br /&gt;
upon him, and secure the possession&lt;br /&gt;
of the forest to himself. In pursu-&lt;br /&gt;
ance of his plan, and to make short&lt;br /&gt;
work of it at once, he leased the&lt;br /&gt;
whole of this southern extremity to&lt;br /&gt;
CHARLES INDIGO, ([^40]) who was&lt;br /&gt;
expressly ordered to take under his&lt;br /&gt;
care and into his family all persons&lt;br /&gt;
who had attended Mr. Bull, in his&lt;br /&gt;
late sickness, in quality of nurses,&lt;br /&gt;
druggists, apothecaries, laundresses,&lt;br /&gt;
upholsters, porters, watchers, &amp;amp;c.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp;c. By this order Charles found&lt;br /&gt;
himself at once surrounded by a large&lt;br /&gt;
body of retainers of various ranks&lt;br /&gt;
and qualities, and being a speculator&lt;br /&gt;
himself, he employed a speculative&lt;br /&gt;
man, Mr. &lt;em&gt;Padlock&lt;/em&gt; (who had written&lt;br /&gt;
a large treatise upon &lt;em&gt;Ideas&lt;/em&gt;) to draw&lt;br /&gt;
up some rules, for the management&lt;br /&gt;
of such a family, intending when he&lt;br /&gt;
should build an house, to paste it up&lt;br /&gt;
in the parlour, as a directory to his&lt;br /&gt;
wife. Accordingly Mr. Padlock&lt;br /&gt;
went to work, and with an exquisite&lt;br /&gt;
mixture of political and metaphysical&lt;br /&gt;
knowledge, distinguished between&lt;br /&gt;
the hall, the parlour, the dressing&lt;br /&gt;
room, the gallery, the music-room,&lt;br /&gt;
the bed-chambers, the chapel, the&lt;br /&gt;
kitchen, the water-closet, &amp;amp;c. shew-&lt;br /&gt;
ing what was to be done in each,&lt;br /&gt;
and the proper subordination of one&lt;br /&gt;
to the other, all which would have&lt;br /&gt;
been of excellent service in a palace,&lt;br /&gt;
and among people who had got to a&lt;br /&gt;
high degree of refinement, but was&lt;br /&gt;
ill suited to the circumstances of new&lt;br /&gt;
adventurers in a forest. They rather&lt;br /&gt;
needed to be instructed in the me-&lt;br /&gt;
thod of felling trees, draining&lt;br /&gt;
swamps, digging clams, guarding&lt;br /&gt;
against musquitoes, killing wolves&lt;br /&gt;
and bears, and erecting huts to keep&lt;br /&gt;
off the weather. To these neces-&lt;br /&gt;
sary affairs they were obliged to at-&lt;br /&gt;
tend, and Mr. Padlock’s fine-spun&lt;br /&gt;
rules were laid by and little thought of.&lt;br /&gt;
Charles had pitched upon a sandy&lt;br /&gt;
point, between two brooks for his&lt;br /&gt;
mansion-house, and had made a small&lt;br /&gt;
beginning when his repose was dis-&lt;br /&gt;
turbed by one AUGUSTINE, ([^41]) a&lt;br /&gt;
lubberly fellow, who had taken a&lt;br /&gt;
lease of Lord STRUT, and lived&lt;br /&gt;
farther southward. This Strut was&lt;br /&gt;
the largest landholder in the coun-&lt;br /&gt;
try, and was never satisfied with ad-&lt;br /&gt;
ding field to field. He had already&lt;br /&gt;
got much more than he could ma-&lt;br /&gt;
nage, and had greatly impoverished&lt;br /&gt;
his home-stead by attending to his&lt;br /&gt;
extra-territories. His tenants were&lt;br /&gt;
infected with the same land-fever,&lt;br /&gt;
and wished to have no neighbors&lt;br /&gt;
within sight or call. From this en-&lt;br /&gt;
vious disposition Augustine collect-&lt;br /&gt;
ed a rabble of lousy fellows, and&lt;br /&gt;
was coming to dispossess Charles,&lt;br /&gt;
thinking him too weak to make a&lt;br /&gt;
defence; but Charles was a lad of&lt;br /&gt;
too much &lt;em&gt;spunk&lt;/em&gt; to be brow-beaten&lt;br /&gt;
by such fellows. He armed all his&lt;br /&gt;
people with some weapon or other,&lt;br /&gt;
and advanced till he came within&lt;br /&gt;
sight of the place where Augustine&lt;br /&gt;
was, who on seeing him, took wit&lt;br /&gt;
in his anger and went back, without&lt;br /&gt;
attempting any mischief.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another difficulty which Charles&lt;br /&gt;
expected to encounter was from the&lt;br /&gt;
wild beasts; but luckily for him,&lt;br /&gt;
these creatures got into a quarrel&lt;br /&gt;
among themselves, and fought with&lt;br /&gt;
each other till they had thinned&lt;br /&gt;
their numbers considerably, so that&lt;br /&gt;
Charles and his companions could&lt;br /&gt;
venture into the woods, where they&lt;br /&gt;
caught some few and tamed them,&lt;br /&gt;
as was the usual practice among all&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Bull’s tenants at that day. Of this&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FORESTERS,\&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An&lt;/em&gt; AMERICAN TALE, &lt;em&gt;being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the
Clothier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Continued from page 622.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must have been remarked by&lt;br /&gt;
every person who has read the&lt;br /&gt;
life and character of Mr. John Bull,&lt;br /&gt;
that he was very whimsical, and as&lt;br /&gt;
positive as he was whimsical. Among&lt;br /&gt;
other advantages which he expect-&lt;br /&gt;
ed from the settlement of his Forest,&lt;br /&gt;
one was, that the wild animals&lt;br /&gt;
whom nature had made ferocious and&lt;br /&gt;
untractable in the highest degree,&lt;br /&gt;
would be rendered tame and ser-&lt;br /&gt;
viceable, by receiving instruction and&lt;br /&gt;
education from the nurturing hand&lt;br /&gt;
of humanity. He had conceived&lt;br /&gt;
a notion that every creature has certain la-&lt;br /&gt;
tent principles and qualities which&lt;br /&gt;
form a foundation for improve-&lt;br /&gt;
ment; and he thought it a great piece&lt;br /&gt;
of injustice that these qualities should&lt;br /&gt;
be suffered to remain uncultivated; he&lt;br /&gt;
had a mind that experiments should be&lt;br /&gt;
attempted to discover how far this&lt;br /&gt;
kind of cultivation was practicable,&lt;br /&gt;
and what use could be made of the&lt;br /&gt;
animal powers under the direction&lt;br /&gt;
and control of rational government.&lt;br /&gt;
Full of this idea, he came to a reso-&lt;br /&gt;
lation [sic], that it should be the duty of&lt;br /&gt;
every one of his tenants to catch&lt;br /&gt;
wild beasts of various sorts, and dis-&lt;br /&gt;
cipline them so as to find out their&lt;br /&gt;
several properties and capacities, and&lt;br /&gt;
use them accordingly; and this kind&lt;br /&gt;
of service was mentioned in their re-&lt;br /&gt;
spective leases as one condition of&lt;br /&gt;
the grants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the tenants, particularly&lt;br /&gt;
Peregrine Pickle, John Codline, and&lt;br /&gt;
Humphry Ploughshare, entered zea-&lt;br /&gt;
lously into the measure from princi-&lt;br /&gt;
ple. They had, during Mr. Bull’s&lt;br /&gt;
sickness and delirium, (before spoken&lt;br /&gt;
of) formed an association for their&lt;br /&gt;
mutual safety. ([^42]) The object of&lt;br /&gt;
their union was two fold: first,&lt;br /&gt;
to endeavour by all fair means to&lt;br /&gt;
tame and discipline the wild beasts;&lt;br /&gt;
and secondly, in case of their prov-&lt;br /&gt;
ing refractory, to defend them-&lt;br /&gt;
selves against their attacks. The&lt;br /&gt;
other tenants did something in the&lt;br /&gt;
same way; some from one principle,&lt;br /&gt;
and some from another. Peter Bull-&lt;br /&gt;
frog, who was as cunning as any of&lt;br /&gt;
them, made use of those which he&lt;br /&gt;
had tamed as his caterers, to pro-&lt;br /&gt;
vide game for his table, of which&lt;br /&gt;
the feathers and furs served him as&lt;br /&gt;
articles of traffic, and brought him&lt;br /&gt;
in a profitable return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The principal consideration (set-&lt;br /&gt;
ting aside interest) which induced&lt;br /&gt;
the more zealous of the Foresters&lt;br /&gt;
to enter into this business, was an&lt;br /&gt;
idea, that these animals were a de-&lt;br /&gt;
generated part of the human spe-&lt;br /&gt;
cies, and might be restored to their&lt;br /&gt;
proper rank and order if due pains&lt;br /&gt;
were taken. The grounds of this&lt;br /&gt;
opinion were these: Among the tra-&lt;br /&gt;
ditions of the ancient Druids there&lt;br /&gt;
was a story, that out of &lt;em&gt;twelve&lt;/em&gt; fa-&lt;br /&gt;
milies which inhabited a certain dis-&lt;br /&gt;
trict by themselves, &lt;em&gt;ten&lt;/em&gt; had been&lt;br /&gt;
lost, and no account could be given&lt;br /&gt;
of them; and, where, said they, is it&lt;br /&gt;
more likely to find them than in&lt;br /&gt;
this forest, in the shape of some&lt;br /&gt;
other creatures? especially, if the&lt;br /&gt;
doctrine of transmigration, which&lt;br /&gt;
the Druids held be true. Ano-&lt;br /&gt;
ther tradition was, that one of Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Bull’s great great uncles, by the&lt;br /&gt;
name of &lt;em&gt;Madok&lt;/em&gt;, had many years&lt;br /&gt;
ago disappeared, and the last ac-&lt;br /&gt;
counts which had been received of&lt;br /&gt;
him was, that he had been seen go-&lt;br /&gt;
ing towards this forest; hence it&lt;br /&gt;
was concluded that his descendants&lt;br /&gt;
must be found there. In confirma-&lt;br /&gt;
tion of this argument, it was al-&lt;br /&gt;
leged, that the sounds which some&lt;br /&gt;
of these creatures made in their&lt;br /&gt;
howlings, resembled the language&lt;br /&gt;
spoken in that day: nay, some were&lt;br /&gt;
positive that they had heard them pro-&lt;br /&gt;
nounce the word ([^43]) &lt;em&gt;Madokawando&lt;/em&gt;;&lt;br /&gt;
and one hunter roundly swore that&lt;br /&gt;
he had seen in the den of a bear, an&lt;br /&gt;
old &lt;em&gt;book&lt;/em&gt; which he supposed to be a &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Bible&lt;/em&gt; written in the Celtic language,&lt;br /&gt;
and this book they concluded must&lt;br /&gt;
have been left there by Madok,&lt;br /&gt;
who could read and speak no other&lt;br /&gt;
language. Another very material&lt;br /&gt;
circumstance was the discovery of a&lt;br /&gt;
rock by the side of a brook, ([^44]) &lt;br /&gt;
inscribed with some characters which&lt;br /&gt;
bore no resemblance to any kind of&lt;br /&gt;
writing, ancient or modern; the&lt;br /&gt;
conclusion from hence was, that it&lt;br /&gt;
must be of the remotest antiquity:&lt;br /&gt;
this rock was deemed an unaccount-&lt;br /&gt;
able curiosity, till a certain virtuoso&lt;br /&gt;
took into his noddle, first to ima-&lt;br /&gt;
gine, and then to become extremely&lt;br /&gt;
positive that the characters were &lt;em&gt;Pu- *&lt;br /&gt;
*nic&lt;/em&gt;; and finally this inscription was&lt;br /&gt;
translated, and affirmed to be no-&lt;br /&gt;
thing less than a treaty of alliance&lt;br /&gt;
between the &lt;em&gt;Phenicians&lt;/em&gt; and the first&lt;br /&gt;
inhabitants of this forest. From&lt;br /&gt;
all these premises it was inferred,&lt;br /&gt;
with some plausibility, and more&lt;br /&gt;
positiveness that one species at least&lt;br /&gt;
of the savage animals was descended&lt;br /&gt;
from &lt;em&gt;Madok&lt;/em&gt;, and that the others&lt;br /&gt;
were the posterity of the long lost &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;ten&lt;/em&gt; families, who were well known&lt;br /&gt;
to have had a commercial connec-&lt;br /&gt;
tion with the &lt;em&gt;Phenicians&lt;/em&gt;, and that&lt;br /&gt;
these probably found out their haunt,&lt;br /&gt;
and followed them for the sake of&lt;br /&gt;
their former friendship. What hap-&lt;br /&gt;
py light do modern discoveries and&lt;br /&gt;
conjectures thrown on the dark pages&lt;br /&gt;
of antiquity!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From these principles, as well as from&lt;br /&gt;
motives of humanity and of interest,&lt;br /&gt;
some of the Foresters entered with&lt;br /&gt;
zeal on the consideration and pract-&lt;br /&gt;
ice of the best methods to fulfil this&lt;br /&gt;
condition of their grants, the disci-&lt;br /&gt;
plining the savage animals, and they&lt;br /&gt;
certainly deserve praise for their ho-&lt;br /&gt;
nest endeavours; but, others who&lt;br /&gt;
pretended to the same zeal, it is to&lt;br /&gt;
be lamented, made use of this pre-&lt;br /&gt;
tence to cover their vanity or their&lt;br /&gt;
avarice. Had none but gentle&lt;br /&gt;
means been used, it is probable&lt;br /&gt;
more good might, on the whole,&lt;br /&gt;
have been produced; but as it often&lt;br /&gt;
happens that many a good project&lt;br /&gt;
has been ruined for want of pru-&lt;br /&gt;
dence in the execution, so it fared&lt;br /&gt;
with this; for while the new comers&lt;br /&gt;
were busy in putting up their huts,&lt;br /&gt;
and preparing the land for cultiva-&lt;br /&gt;
tion, (both which were necessary&lt;br /&gt;
before they could attend to any&lt;br /&gt;
other business) some of the savage&lt;br /&gt;
tribe would be a little impertinent,&lt;br /&gt;
either by peeping into the huts, or&lt;br /&gt;
breaking up a nest where the poul-&lt;br /&gt;
try were hatching, or carrying off a&lt;br /&gt;
chick or a gosling. These imperti-&lt;br /&gt;
nencies bred frequent quarrels, and&lt;br /&gt;
the poor creatures were sometimes&lt;br /&gt;
driven off with bloody noses, or&lt;br /&gt;
obliged to hop on three legs, or&lt;br /&gt;
even laid sprawling and slyly cover-&lt;br /&gt;
ed with earth, no service or ceremo-&lt;br /&gt;
ny being said over the carcase, and&lt;br /&gt;
no other epitaph than “Poh, they&lt;br /&gt;
are nothing but brutes, and where’s&lt;br /&gt;
the harm of killing them!” or in&lt;br /&gt;
rhyme thus:\&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Tit for tat, tit for tat,\
“He stole my chick and I broke his back.”&lt;br /&gt;
Whatever plausible excuses might&lt;br /&gt;
have been made for these proceed-&lt;br /&gt;
ings, they served to render the&lt;br /&gt;
other creatures jealous of their new&lt;br /&gt;
neighbors; but instead of abating&lt;br /&gt;
their appetite for mischief, it sharp-&lt;br /&gt;
ened their invention to take more&lt;br /&gt;
sly methods of accomplishing it.&lt;br /&gt;
The more wary of them kept aloof&lt;br /&gt;
in the day time, and would not be&lt;br /&gt;
enticed by the arts which were used&lt;br /&gt;
to draw them in; however, they&lt;br /&gt;
were sometimes pinched for food,&lt;br /&gt;
and the new inhabitants used to&lt;br /&gt;
throw crusts of bread, handfuls of corn,&lt;br /&gt;
and other eatables, in&lt;br /&gt;
their way, which allured them by&lt;br /&gt;
degrees to familiarity. After a&lt;br /&gt;
while it was found that nothing suc-&lt;br /&gt;
ceeded so well as &lt;em&gt;melasses&lt;/em&gt;: it was&lt;br /&gt;
therefore thought a capital manoeu-&lt;br /&gt;
vre to drop a train of it on the&lt;br /&gt;
ground, which the creatures would&lt;br /&gt;
follow, licking it, till they had in-&lt;br /&gt;
sensibly got up to the doors of the&lt;br /&gt;
houses, where, if any body held a&lt;br /&gt;
bowl or a plate besmeared with the&lt;br /&gt;
liquor, they would come and put&lt;br /&gt;
their noses into it, and then you&lt;br /&gt;
might pat them on the back&lt;br /&gt;
and sides, or stroke them, say-&lt;br /&gt;
ing, “poor Bruin, poor Isgrim,&lt;br /&gt;
poor Reynard, poor Puss,” and the&lt;br /&gt;
like, and they should suffer them-&lt;br /&gt;
selves to be handled and fondled till&lt;br /&gt;
they dropped asleep. When they&lt;br /&gt;
awaked they would make a moan&lt;br /&gt;
and wag their tails as if they were&lt;br /&gt;
asking for more, and if it was de-&lt;br /&gt;
nied them, they would retire to the&lt;br /&gt;
woods in disgust, till the scent of&lt;br /&gt;
the melasses operating on their de-&lt;br /&gt;
praved appetites, invited them to&lt;br /&gt;
return where it was to be had. This&lt;br /&gt;
was upon repeated trial found to be&lt;br /&gt;
the most effectual way of taming&lt;br /&gt;
them, as they might be taught to&lt;br /&gt;
imitate any kind of tricks and ges-&lt;br /&gt;
tures if a dish of melasses was held&lt;br /&gt;
out as a reward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Foresters knew that they&lt;br /&gt;
could not ingratiate themselves bet-&lt;br /&gt;
ter with their old master Bull, than&lt;br /&gt;
by humouring his itch for pro-&lt;br /&gt;
jects. They therefore took care to&lt;br /&gt;
raise reports and write letters from&lt;br /&gt;
time to time concerning the won-&lt;br /&gt;
derful success which they had met&lt;br /&gt;
with in civilizing the savage animals.&lt;br /&gt;
Bull was greatly pleased with these&lt;br /&gt;
reports, and made a practice of send-&lt;br /&gt;
ing presents of trinkets to be dis-&lt;br /&gt;
tributed among them; such as col-&lt;br /&gt;
lars, ear-rings, and nose-jewels. Se-&lt;br /&gt;
veral times some of the most stately&lt;br /&gt;
and best instructed of them were car-&lt;br /&gt;
ried to his house for a show, where&lt;br /&gt;
he had them dressed up in scarlet&lt;br /&gt;
and gold trappings, and led through&lt;br /&gt;
all his apartments for the entertain-&lt;br /&gt;
ment of his family, and feasted with&lt;br /&gt;
every nick-nack which his cook&lt;br /&gt;
and confectioner could procure.&lt;br /&gt;
He was so fond of being thought&lt;br /&gt;
their patron and protector, that he&lt;br /&gt;
usually spoke of them as his &lt;em&gt;red *&lt;br /&gt;
*children&lt;/em&gt;, from the colour of their&lt;br /&gt;
hides. It is not many years since&lt;br /&gt;
one of them, after being led through&lt;br /&gt;
several families and plantations of&lt;br /&gt;
the tenants, was carried home to&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Bull’s own house, dressed in&lt;br /&gt;
the habit of a &lt;em&gt;clergyman&lt;/em&gt;, having&lt;br /&gt;
been previously taught to lift his&lt;br /&gt;
paw and roll his eyes as if in the act&lt;br /&gt;
of devotion. This trick was so well&lt;br /&gt;
carried on that the managers of it&lt;br /&gt;
picked up a large pocket full of&lt;br /&gt;
pence, by exhibiting him for a raree-&lt;br /&gt;
show, and the money was applied&lt;br /&gt;
toward building a &lt;em&gt;menagerie&lt;/em&gt;, where&lt;br /&gt;
beasts of all kinds might be brought&lt;br /&gt;
and tamed. This project, like ma-&lt;br /&gt;
ny such whims, has proved of more&lt;br /&gt;
profit to the projectors, than bene-&lt;br /&gt;
fit to the public; for most of those&lt;br /&gt;
who were supposed to be tamed and&lt;br /&gt;
domesticated, after they had been&lt;br /&gt;
sent back to their native woods&lt;br /&gt;
with a view to their being instru-&lt;br /&gt;
mental in taming their fellow-sa-&lt;br /&gt;
vages, have returned to their former&lt;br /&gt;
ferocious habits, and some of them&lt;br /&gt;
have proved greater rogues than&lt;br /&gt;
ever, and have done more mischief&lt;br /&gt;
than they could otherwise have been&lt;br /&gt;
capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bull himself was once so full&lt;br /&gt;
of the project, that he got his chap-&lt;br /&gt;
lain and some others to form them-&lt;br /&gt;
selves into a club ([^45]), the professed&lt;br /&gt;
object of which was to propagate&lt;br /&gt;
knowledge among these savage crea-&lt;br /&gt;
tures. After some trials which did&lt;br /&gt;
not answer expectation, old madam&lt;br /&gt;
Bull conceived that the money which&lt;br /&gt;
was collected might as well be ex-&lt;br /&gt;
pended in teaching Mr. Bull’s own&lt;br /&gt;
tenants themselves a little better&lt;br /&gt;
manners; for some of them were ra-&lt;br /&gt;
ther awkward and slovenly in their&lt;br /&gt;
deportment, while others were de-&lt;br /&gt;
cent and devout &lt;em&gt;in their own way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Madam, as we have before obser-&lt;br /&gt;
ved, was a great zealot in the cause&lt;br /&gt;
of &lt;em&gt;uniformity&lt;/em&gt;, and had a vast influ-&lt;br /&gt;
ence over her son, by virtue of which&lt;br /&gt;
the attention of the club was prin-&lt;br /&gt;
cipally directed to the promoting&lt;br /&gt;
this grand object. Accordingly,&lt;br /&gt;
every one of the tenants was fur-&lt;br /&gt;
nished with a bible and a prayer-&lt;br /&gt;
book, a clean napkin, bason, platter&lt;br /&gt;
and chalice, with a few devotional&lt;br /&gt;
tracts, and some young adventurers&lt;br /&gt;
who had been educated in the fami-&lt;br /&gt;
ly, were recommended as chaplains;&lt;br /&gt;
who had also by-orders to keep a&lt;br /&gt;
look out toward the savage animals,&lt;br /&gt;
when they should fall in their way.&lt;br /&gt;
The chaplains were tolerably well&lt;br /&gt;
received in most of the families;&lt;br /&gt;
but some, particularly Codline and&lt;br /&gt;
Ploughshare, who gloried in being&lt;br /&gt;
able to say &lt;em&gt;without book&lt;/em&gt;, always&lt;br /&gt;
looked sour upon them, and would&lt;br /&gt;
frequently say to them, “Go, take&lt;br /&gt;
care of the savage objects of your&lt;br /&gt;
mission, and don’t come here to&lt;br /&gt;
teach us, ‘till you have learned bet-&lt;br /&gt;
ter yourselves.” The chaplains in&lt;br /&gt;
disgust, and perhaps in revenge (for&lt;br /&gt;
they were but men of like passions)&lt;br /&gt;
would pout and swell and call &lt;em&gt;schis- *&lt;br /&gt;
*matic&lt;/em&gt; and other canonical nick-&lt;br /&gt;
names, of which there is extant a&lt;br /&gt;
large vocabulary, and would fre-&lt;br /&gt;
quently write letters, much to the&lt;br /&gt;
disadvantage of their opponents. It&lt;br /&gt;
is not many years since they, with&lt;br /&gt;
the club which sent them, were pret-&lt;br /&gt;
ty severely handled by one of Cod-&lt;br /&gt;
line’s own Chaplains, and it is sup-&lt;br /&gt;
posed that they have ever since been&lt;br /&gt;
abating their arrogance; certain it&lt;br /&gt;
is that they are on better terms &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
with their neighbors than ever;&lt;br /&gt;
this may, in part, be owing to some&lt;br /&gt;
other circumstances, but be the cause&lt;br /&gt;
what it may, it is looked upon by&lt;br /&gt;
the judicious, as one of the most&lt;br /&gt;
hopeful among the signs of the times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;To be continued.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[6. November 1787]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FORESTERS,\&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An&lt;/em&gt; AMERICAN TALE, &lt;em&gt;being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the
Clothier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Continued from page 710.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been observed, that the&lt;br /&gt;
lease which Mr. Bull gave to &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Charles Indigo&lt;/em&gt;, obliged him to re-&lt;br /&gt;
ceive into his family all such persons&lt;br /&gt;
as had been attendants on Mr. Bull&lt;br /&gt;
during his sickness, and for whom&lt;br /&gt;
he had no other means of provid-&lt;br /&gt;
ing. This general indulgence pro-&lt;br /&gt;
cured to Charles the reputation of&lt;br /&gt;
a very friendly, hospitable person,&lt;br /&gt;
and induced great numbers of other&lt;br /&gt;
people of various characters, views,&lt;br /&gt;
and interests, to seek an assylum&lt;br /&gt;
within his limits. About this time&lt;br /&gt;
old Lewis had grown sick and pee-&lt;br /&gt;
vish, and had severely cudgelled&lt;br /&gt;
some of his apprentices, because they&lt;br /&gt;
did not make their P’s and Q’s ex-&lt;br /&gt;
actly to his mind ([^46]). The poor&lt;br /&gt;
fellows, to prevent worse treatment,&lt;br /&gt;
fled from his house, and took refuge&lt;br /&gt;
with Mr. Bull, who treated them&lt;br /&gt;
civilly, and recommended them&lt;br /&gt;
to the Forest, where they dispersed&lt;br /&gt;
in the several families of his tenants,&lt;br /&gt;
and a large party of them took up&lt;br /&gt;
their abode with Charles, to whose&lt;br /&gt;
family they proved an industrious,&lt;br /&gt;
profitable acquisition, though some&lt;br /&gt;
of the family looked a little sourly upon them.&lt;br /&gt;
This facility of admitting strangers&lt;br /&gt;
produced an effect which had almost&lt;br /&gt;
proved fatal to the reputation of the&lt;br /&gt;
family; for a number of highway-&lt;br /&gt;
men ([^47]) also sought shelter there,&lt;br /&gt;
and by means of their gold and sil-&lt;br /&gt;
ver, which they had in plenty, made&lt;br /&gt;
friends in the house, and were ad-&lt;br /&gt;
mitted by night at a back door.&lt;br /&gt;
After a while they grew more bold&lt;br /&gt;
and came in the day time, under&lt;br /&gt;
the disguise of pedlars, with packs&lt;br /&gt;
on their shoulders. One of them&lt;br /&gt;
actually took his stand behind a cor-&lt;br /&gt;
ner of one of the fences, from&lt;br /&gt;
whence he sallied out on travellers;&lt;br /&gt;
this corner obtained, from that cir-&lt;br /&gt;
cumstance, the name of &lt;em&gt;Point-Fear&lt;/em&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
and as the first names of places are&lt;br /&gt;
not easily got rid of, it retains the&lt;br /&gt;
name to this day, and perhaps will&lt;br /&gt;
ever retain it. Here the rascal in-&lt;br /&gt;
tended to have built himself a lodge,&lt;br /&gt;
and taken up his quarters for life;&lt;br /&gt;
but the matter was now grown so&lt;br /&gt;
public, that Charles, for the honour&lt;br /&gt;
of his family, ordered all stragglers&lt;br /&gt;
to be seized, and this fellow in par-&lt;br /&gt;
ticular, after a severe struggle, was&lt;br /&gt;
apprehended and brought to justice.&lt;br /&gt;
The same spot was afterward tak-&lt;br /&gt;
en possession of by &lt;em&gt;Peter Pitch&lt;/em&gt;, ([^48]) &lt;br /&gt;
a poor fellow who got his living as&lt;br /&gt;
he did his name, from collecting the&lt;br /&gt;
resinous juice of the numerous pines&lt;br /&gt;
which grew thereabouts. He had&lt;br /&gt;
to work hard and fare hard, and go&lt;br /&gt;
a great way for his victuals and&lt;br /&gt;
clothes; but after he had lived alone&lt;br /&gt;
for some time, he picked up one&lt;br /&gt;
or two acquaintances of his own stamp,&lt;br /&gt;
and they formed a family which was&lt;br /&gt;
at first rather disorderly. Farther&lt;br /&gt;
discovery of the lands, and the ad-&lt;br /&gt;
vantage of the water-carriage, in-&lt;br /&gt;
duced some other people to sit down&lt;br /&gt;
by him, and in process of time he&lt;br /&gt;
became so respectable as to be no-&lt;br /&gt;
ticed by Mr. Bull, who, though he&lt;br /&gt;
never gave him a lease in form, yet&lt;br /&gt;
let him have cloth and haberdashery&lt;br /&gt;
upon credit, and took his pitch in&lt;br /&gt;
payment as fast as he could collect&lt;br /&gt;
it. This kept him in a dependent&lt;br /&gt;
state, and subjected him to impo-&lt;br /&gt;
sitions from Bull’s clerks and jour-&lt;br /&gt;
neymen. It is not many years since&lt;br /&gt;
Bull sent him a taylor to &lt;em&gt;try-on&lt;/em&gt; a&lt;br /&gt;
new coat, ([^49]) which was so strait&lt;br /&gt;
that it split in several places, and&lt;br /&gt;
never could be altered so as to fit&lt;br /&gt;
him, but he was obliged to wear it&lt;br /&gt;
rather than quarrel with his patron.&lt;br /&gt;
This same taylor was remarkable for &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;cabbaging&lt;/em&gt;, as Peter Bull-Frog and&lt;br /&gt;
Humphry Ploughshare have since had&lt;br /&gt;
large experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To finish what relates to Charles&lt;br /&gt;
Indigo, we shall observe, that the&lt;br /&gt;
land on which he began his planta-&lt;br /&gt;
tion, was in general so wet and miry,&lt;br /&gt;
that it was unfavourable to the pro-&lt;br /&gt;
duction of wheat, and it was for&lt;br /&gt;
some time doubtful whether he&lt;br /&gt;
would be able to raise his own bread.&lt;br /&gt;
Chance at length effected what la-&lt;br /&gt;
bour and ingenuity could not: a&lt;br /&gt;
bird of passage having dropped some&lt;br /&gt;
kernels of rice in his dung it was&lt;br /&gt;
found to thrive exceedingly well;&lt;br /&gt;
from whence the hint was taken,&lt;br /&gt;
and rice became the standard grain&lt;br /&gt;
of the plantation. By the cultiva-&lt;br /&gt;
tion of this, and of a weed which&lt;br /&gt;
was useful to the dyers; he grew&lt;br /&gt;
rich, and made a sightly figure&lt;br /&gt;
among his neighbours in point of&lt;br /&gt;
dress and equipage, though his&lt;br /&gt;
countenance is rather sallow, and&lt;br /&gt;
he is subject to frequent returns of&lt;br /&gt;
the intermittent fever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the extensive lease given to In-&lt;br /&gt;
digo and his associates, most of Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Bull’s dependants and attendants&lt;br /&gt;
were provided for, and their services&lt;br /&gt;
recompensed with a shew of gene-&lt;br /&gt;
rosity on his part, and of satisfac-&lt;br /&gt;
tion on theirs. We have before just&lt;br /&gt;
hinted at a grant made to &lt;em&gt;William *&lt;br /&gt;
*Broad Brim&lt;/em&gt; ([^50]), of which we shall&lt;br /&gt;
give a more particular account.&lt;br /&gt;
His father had been an old ser-&lt;br /&gt;
vant of Mr. Bull, and had been em-&lt;br /&gt;
ployed in the very laborious and ne-&lt;br /&gt;
cessary business of catching and&lt;br /&gt;
killing rats. In this employment&lt;br /&gt;
he was so very dexterous and suc-&lt;br /&gt;
cessful that he recommended him-&lt;br /&gt;
self highly to his master, who not&lt;br /&gt;
only allowed him large wages&lt;br /&gt;
but promised him farther recompense.&lt;br /&gt;
During Mr. Bull’s sickness, the&lt;br /&gt;
care and diligence of this faithful&lt;br /&gt;
servant had been unremitted and his&lt;br /&gt;
merits were thereby increased, so&lt;br /&gt;
that Mr. Bull on his recovery found&lt;br /&gt;
himself deeply indebted to him, and&lt;br /&gt;
he still continued his services; till,&lt;br /&gt;
worn out with age and infirmity,&lt;br /&gt;
he died and had an honorable fu-&lt;br /&gt;
neral.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His son William then became his&lt;br /&gt;
heir, and solicited for payment of&lt;br /&gt;
the arrears due to his father, which&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Bull, according to the maxim&lt;br /&gt;
he had laid down for himself, and&lt;br /&gt;
urged by the necessity of the occa-&lt;br /&gt;
sion, proposed to discharge by a&lt;br /&gt;
lease of part of the Forest. This&lt;br /&gt;
happened to fall in, exactly, with&lt;br /&gt;
William’s views, which were of a&lt;br /&gt;
singular nature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;About this time a nervous dis-&lt;br /&gt;
order appeared in Bull’s family&lt;br /&gt;
which went by the name of the&lt;br /&gt;
([^51]) &lt;em&gt;shaking palsy&lt;/em&gt;. We shall not&lt;br /&gt;
pretend to trace the causes of it,&lt;br /&gt;
as the origin of such things is often&lt;br /&gt;
obscure and impenetrable; but the&lt;br /&gt;
effects were, a trembling of the&lt;br /&gt;
nerves, a stiffness in the neck and&lt;br /&gt;
shoulders, and a hesitancy in the&lt;br /&gt;
speech, so that it was impossible&lt;br /&gt;
for the patients to pronounce cer-&lt;br /&gt;
tain words and syllables, such as&lt;br /&gt;
Sir, Madam, your honor, my lord,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp;c. nor could one of them raise his&lt;br /&gt;
hand to take off his hat, or hold it&lt;br /&gt;
up when an oath was to be admi-&lt;br /&gt;
nistered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mr. Bull’s choleric temper misin-&lt;br /&gt;
terpreted this natural infirmity into&lt;br /&gt;
a sullen disrespect. When he found&lt;br /&gt;
a change in the behaviour of these&lt;br /&gt;
domestics; that instead of bowing to&lt;br /&gt;
him they stood upright as a May-&lt;br /&gt;
pole, and instead of sir, and your ho-&lt;br /&gt;
nor, they could utter nothing but &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Friend&lt;/em&gt;, he grew angry, and made a&lt;br /&gt;
pretty free use of his fist, and when&lt;br /&gt;
he found that they could not be&lt;br /&gt;
cured by such means, he thrust some&lt;br /&gt;
of them into a dark closet, and shut&lt;br /&gt;
them up till they should (as he&lt;br /&gt;
termed it) “learn better manners;”&lt;br /&gt;
and it is supposed he would have car-&lt;br /&gt;
ried his resentment much further,&lt;br /&gt;
but for this circumstance; William&lt;br /&gt;
Broadbrim, who had himself strong&lt;br /&gt;
symptoms of the disorder, whispered&lt;br /&gt;
to Mr. Bull, that if he would give&lt;br /&gt;
him time to ripen a project, which&lt;br /&gt;
he had conceived, he would rid him&lt;br /&gt;
of all trouble with these people.&lt;br /&gt;
William had a plodding genius, and&lt;br /&gt;
the scheme with which his head was&lt;br /&gt;
pregnant at this time, was nothing&lt;br /&gt;
more or less than to make a settle-&lt;br /&gt;
ment in the forest, and take all these&lt;br /&gt;
people with him. Bull, who was&lt;br /&gt;
glad to get rid of them, and of the&lt;br /&gt;
debt which he owed to William,&lt;br /&gt;
readily fell in with the project; and&lt;br /&gt;
a grant was made out under hand&lt;br /&gt;
and seal, wherein William Broad-&lt;br /&gt;
brim, and his heirs, were invested&lt;br /&gt;
with the right of soil, and all other&lt;br /&gt;
privileges of proprietorship, in a cer-&lt;br /&gt;
tain part of the forest, between the&lt;br /&gt;
plantation of Frederic Marygold,&lt;br /&gt;
and that of Cart-rut and Bare-clay,&lt;br /&gt;
being in the neighborhood of the&lt;br /&gt;
spot where Casimir had rebuilt his&lt;br /&gt;
hut, and lived in an ambiguous situ-&lt;br /&gt;
ation, not knowing who was his&lt;br /&gt;
landlord. With him William made&lt;br /&gt;
a peaceable compromise, saying,&lt;br /&gt;
“Friend, I will do thee no violence,&lt;br /&gt;
there is room enough for us both.”&lt;br /&gt;
Casimir was glad of so good a neigh-&lt;br /&gt;
bor, and he had reason to be, for&lt;br /&gt;
he throve more rapidly after this&lt;br /&gt;
than before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;William pitched upon a level&lt;br /&gt;
piece of ground, where two large&lt;br /&gt;
brooks met, for the situation of his&lt;br /&gt;
mansion-house, and went to work to&lt;br /&gt;
draw up rules for the government&lt;br /&gt;
of his family. One of which was,&lt;br /&gt;
that no person should be refused&lt;br /&gt;
admittance into it, or disturbed&lt;br /&gt;
in it, or cast out of it, on ac-&lt;br /&gt;
count of any natural infirmity.&lt;br /&gt;
Another was, that no arms, nor&lt;br /&gt;
ammunition, should ever be made&lt;br /&gt;
use of on any pretence whatever.&lt;br /&gt;
The first of these rules gained Wil-&lt;br /&gt;
liam great reputation among all sen-&lt;br /&gt;
sible men; the latter was a notion&lt;br /&gt;
which candor would lead us to sup-&lt;br /&gt;
pose proceeded partly from the dis-&lt;br /&gt;
order of his nerves, and partly from&lt;br /&gt;
a love of peace, and the exercise of&lt;br /&gt;
good will toward his fellow crea-&lt;br /&gt;
tures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When any of William’s neigh-&lt;br /&gt;
bors, who were of a different way&lt;br /&gt;
of thinking, spake to him of the im-&lt;br /&gt;
policy of this rule, and asked him how&lt;br /&gt;
he expected to defend himself and his&lt;br /&gt;
family against the wild beasts, if&lt;br /&gt;
they should attack him; William,&lt;br /&gt;
(who was fond of harangue) would&lt;br /&gt;
answer thus–“There is in all crea-&lt;br /&gt;
tures a certain instinct, which dis-&lt;br /&gt;
poseth them to peace. This instinct&lt;br /&gt;
is so strong and fixed, that upon it,&lt;br /&gt;
as upon a foundation, may be erect-&lt;br /&gt;
ed a complete system of love and&lt;br /&gt;
concord, which all the powers of&lt;br /&gt;
anarchy shall not be able to over-&lt;br /&gt;
throw. To cultivate and improve&lt;br /&gt;
this instinct is the business of every&lt;br /&gt;
wise man, and he may reasonably&lt;br /&gt;
expect that an example of this kind,&lt;br /&gt;
if steadily and regularly adhered to,&lt;br /&gt;
will have a very extensive and bene-&lt;br /&gt;
ficial influence, on all sorts of crea-&lt;br /&gt;
tures; even the wild beasts of the fo-&lt;br /&gt;
rest will become tame as the lambs,&lt;br /&gt;
and birds of prey as harmless as&lt;br /&gt;
doves. Dost thou not see, friend,&lt;br /&gt;
what influence my example has al-&lt;br /&gt;
ready had on those creatures which&lt;br /&gt;
are deemed savage? I go into their&lt;br /&gt;
dens with safety, and they enter my&lt;br /&gt;
habitation without fear. When&lt;br /&gt;
they are hungry I feed them, when&lt;br /&gt;
they are thirsty I give them drink,&lt;br /&gt;
and they in return bear my burdens,&lt;br /&gt;
and do such other kind offices&lt;br /&gt;
as they are capable of, and I require of&lt;br /&gt;
them. I have even tamed some of&lt;br /&gt;
them so far, that they have sold me&lt;br /&gt;
the land on which they live, and&lt;br /&gt;
have acknowledged the bargain by&lt;br /&gt;
a mark made with their toe-nails on&lt;br /&gt;
parchment. They are certainly&lt;br /&gt;
some of the best natured creatures&lt;br /&gt;
in the world; their native instinct&lt;br /&gt;
leads them to love and peace, and&lt;br /&gt;
sociability, and as long as I set&lt;br /&gt;
them a good example I have no&lt;br /&gt;
doubt they will follow it. When&lt;br /&gt;
such is my opinion and expectation,&lt;br /&gt;
why should I be anxious about what&lt;br /&gt;
may, and I trust never will happen?&lt;br /&gt;
Why should I put myself in a pos-&lt;br /&gt;
ture of defence against those who&lt;br /&gt;
will never attack me? or, why&lt;br /&gt;
should I by the appearance of jea-&lt;br /&gt;
lousy and distrust on my part, of-&lt;br /&gt;
fend those who now put confidence&lt;br /&gt;
in me? No, No, I will not suppose&lt;br /&gt;
that they will ever hurt me. I will&lt;br /&gt;
not suffer the &lt;em&gt;carnal weapon&lt;/em&gt; to be&lt;br /&gt;
seen in my house, nor shall one of&lt;br /&gt;
my family ever learn the detestable&lt;br /&gt;
practice of pulling the trigger. I&lt;br /&gt;
leave the instruments of destruction&lt;br /&gt;
to the offspring of Cain and the seed&lt;br /&gt;
of the serpent; while I meekly imi-&lt;br /&gt;
tate the gentleness of the lamb, and&lt;br /&gt;
the innocence of the dove.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With such harangues William&lt;br /&gt;
would frequently entertain himself&lt;br /&gt;
and his friends, and he was so san-&lt;br /&gt;
guine in his benevolent project, that&lt;br /&gt;
instead of having his own name (as was&lt;br /&gt;
usual) written over his door, he had&lt;br /&gt;
the words BROTHERLY LOVE, trans-&lt;br /&gt;
lated into a foreign language, and&lt;br /&gt;
inscribed in golden characters, as&lt;br /&gt;
a standing invitation to persons&lt;br /&gt;
of all nations and characters to&lt;br /&gt;
come and take shelter under his&lt;br /&gt;
roof.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;To be continued.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[7. December 1787]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FORESTERS:\&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An&lt;/em&gt; AMERICAN TALE, &lt;em&gt;being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the
Clothier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Continued from page 741.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The general invitation which&lt;br /&gt;
William Broadbrim had gi-&lt;br /&gt;
ven to all persons who were desti-&lt;br /&gt;
tute of a home, to come and take&lt;br /&gt;
shelter under his roof, and the gen-&lt;br /&gt;
tle humane treatment which those&lt;br /&gt;
who accepted the invitation met&lt;br /&gt;
with, spread his fame abroad,&lt;br /&gt;
and brought him much company. His&lt;br /&gt;
family was sometimes compared to&lt;br /&gt;
the Ark of Noah, because there&lt;br /&gt;
was scarcely any kind of human&lt;br /&gt;
being, of whatever shape, size, com-&lt;br /&gt;
plexion, disposition, language or&lt;br /&gt;
religion, but what might be found&lt;br /&gt;
there. He had also the art to keep&lt;br /&gt;
them pretty well employed. Indu-&lt;br /&gt;
stry, frugality, and œconomy, were&lt;br /&gt;
the leading principles of his family,&lt;br /&gt;
and their thriving was in a ratio&lt;br /&gt;
compounded of these three forces.&lt;br /&gt;
Nothing was wanting to make them&lt;br /&gt;
as happy a family as any in the&lt;br /&gt;
world, but a disposition among&lt;br /&gt;
themselves, to live in peace. Un-&lt;br /&gt;
luckily, however, this desirable&lt;br /&gt;
blessing, on account of the variety&lt;br /&gt;
of their humours and interests, was&lt;br /&gt;
seldom found among them. Am-&lt;br /&gt;
bition, jealousy, avarice, and party&lt;br /&gt;
spirit, had frequent out-breakings,&lt;br /&gt;
and were with difficulty quelled. It&lt;br /&gt;
is needless to enter into a very par-&lt;br /&gt;
ticular discussion of the grounds or&lt;br /&gt;
effects of these dissentions: family-&lt;br /&gt;
quarrels are not very entertaining&lt;br /&gt;
either at home or abroad, unless to&lt;br /&gt;
such as delight in scandal, and it is&lt;br /&gt;
presumed the readers of this narra-&lt;br /&gt;
tive are not of that number. But&lt;br /&gt;
there was one cause of dissention&lt;br /&gt;
which it would be improper not to&lt;br /&gt;
notice, because we have already&lt;br /&gt;
hinted at the principle from which&lt;br /&gt;
it proceeded. William’s aversion&lt;br /&gt;
to fire arms was so strong, that he&lt;br /&gt;
would not suffer any of his family&lt;br /&gt;
to molest the wild inhabitants of&lt;br /&gt;
the forest, though they were ever&lt;br /&gt;
so mischievous. While the family&lt;br /&gt;
was small, the savage animals who&lt;br /&gt;
lived in the neighborhood being&lt;br /&gt;
well fed, were tolerably tame and&lt;br /&gt;
civil, but when the encreased num-&lt;br /&gt;
ber of the family had penetrated&lt;br /&gt;
farther into the forest, the haunts of&lt;br /&gt;
the natives were disturbed and the&lt;br /&gt;
straggling labourers were sometimes&lt;br /&gt;
surprised, and having nothing to&lt;br /&gt;
defend themselves with, fell a sa-&lt;br /&gt;
crifice to savage resentment. Re-&lt;br /&gt;
monstrances were presented to Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Broadbrim one after another, but&lt;br /&gt;
he always insisted on it that the suf-&lt;br /&gt;
ferer must have been the aggressor,&lt;br /&gt;
and that “they who take the&lt;br /&gt;
sword must expect to perish by the&lt;br /&gt;
sword.” At length the dead corpse&lt;br /&gt;
of one of the labourers, mangled&lt;br /&gt;
and torn in a dreadful manner, was&lt;br /&gt;
brought and laid at the door of&lt;br /&gt;
William’s parlour ([^52]) with a label&lt;br /&gt;
affixed to the breast, on which were&lt;br /&gt;
written these words, “Thou thy-&lt;br /&gt;
self must be accounted my murder-&lt;br /&gt;
er, because thou didst deny me the&lt;br /&gt;
means of defence.” At sight of&lt;br /&gt;
this horrid spectacle, Broadbrim&lt;br /&gt;
turned pale! The eye of his mind&lt;br /&gt;
looked inward! Nature began to&lt;br /&gt;
plead her own cause within him!&lt;br /&gt;
he gave way in some degree to her&lt;br /&gt;
operations, though contrary to his&lt;br /&gt;
pre-conceived opinion, and with a&lt;br /&gt;
trembling hand signed a permission&lt;br /&gt;
for those to use the ([^53]) &lt;em&gt;carnal wea- *&lt;br /&gt;
*pon&lt;/em&gt;, who could do it without scru-&lt;br /&gt;
ple; and when they asked him for&lt;br /&gt;
money to buy guns, powder and&lt;br /&gt;
ball, he gave them a certain sum to&lt;br /&gt;
provide &lt;em&gt;the necessaries of life&lt;/em&gt;, leav-&lt;br /&gt;
ing them to put their own construc-&lt;br /&gt;
tion on the words. By degrees&lt;br /&gt;
his squeamishness grew less public,&lt;br /&gt;
and though it is imagined he has&lt;br /&gt;
still some remainder of it, yet ne-&lt;br /&gt;
cessity has so often overcome it&lt;br /&gt;
that there is not much said on the&lt;br /&gt;
subject, unless it be very privately&lt;br /&gt;
and among &lt;em&gt;friends&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the time of which we&lt;br /&gt;
have been speaking Mr. John Bull&lt;br /&gt;
had undergone another sickness ([^54]),&lt;br /&gt;
not so long nor so violent as the&lt;br /&gt;
former but much more beneficial in&lt;br /&gt;
its effects. His new physicians had&lt;br /&gt;
administered medicines which com-&lt;br /&gt;
posed his nerves, he eat, drank&lt;br /&gt;
and slept more regularly, and conversed&lt;br /&gt;
more frequently with his wife ([^55])&lt;br /&gt;
than heretofore. By these means&lt;br /&gt;
his vigour was renewed, but still&lt;br /&gt;
his whimsical disposition remained,&lt;br /&gt;
and broke out on several occasions.&lt;br /&gt;
When he viewed his extensive for-&lt;br /&gt;
est, now planted and thriving, un-&lt;br /&gt;
der the honest hand of industry, he&lt;br /&gt;
thought within himself that still&lt;br /&gt;
greater advantages might be derived&lt;br /&gt;
from that territory. There was&lt;br /&gt;
yet a part of it unsettled between&lt;br /&gt;
the plantation of Charles Indigo,&lt;br /&gt;
and the dominions of Lord Strut;&lt;br /&gt;
and Bull thought it a pity to let so&lt;br /&gt;
much remain a wilderness. The&lt;br /&gt;
other plantations had been made by&lt;br /&gt;
discontented servants and needy ad-&lt;br /&gt;
venturers who struggling with hard-&lt;br /&gt;
ships, by a steady perseverance had&lt;br /&gt;
surmounted many difficulties, and&lt;br /&gt;
obtained a comfortable living.&lt;br /&gt;
“Now (said Bull) if these fellows&lt;br /&gt;
have done so well, and got so far&lt;br /&gt;
aforehand, without having any ca-&lt;br /&gt;
pital of their own to begin with,&lt;br /&gt;
what cannot be done by the force&lt;br /&gt;
of my great capital? If they have&lt;br /&gt;
performed such wonders, what great-&lt;br /&gt;
er wonders may be brought into&lt;br /&gt;
view by my own exertions, with all&lt;br /&gt;
the advantages which it is in my&lt;br /&gt;
power to command? To it, boys,&lt;br /&gt;
I vow I’ll have a farm of my own&lt;br /&gt;
that shall beat you all!”–Having&lt;br /&gt;
conceived this project, his brains&lt;br /&gt;
immediately became pregnant with&lt;br /&gt;
ideas; but according to the rule&lt;br /&gt;
which he had lately prescribed to&lt;br /&gt;
himself he communicated the matter&lt;br /&gt;
to his wife. This good lady, though&lt;br /&gt;
prudent, was not free from a ro-&lt;br /&gt;
mantic turn of mind. She was ex-&lt;br /&gt;
tremely fond of having it thought&lt;br /&gt;
that she had great influence over her&lt;br /&gt;
husband, and would sometimes gra-&lt;br /&gt;
tify his humour at the expense of her&lt;br /&gt;
own judgment, rather than not&lt;br /&gt;
keep up this idea. His expectations&lt;br /&gt;
from his new project were very san-&lt;br /&gt;
guine. The land on which he had&lt;br /&gt;
cast his eye was enough for a large&lt;br /&gt;
farm; it had a southern exposure,&lt;br /&gt;
it was warm, rich and fertile in some&lt;br /&gt;
parts, and in others boggy or sandy.&lt;br /&gt;
He had conversed with some fo-&lt;br /&gt;
reigners, who told him that it was&lt;br /&gt;
proper for the cultivation of wine&lt;br /&gt;
and silk, and he imagined that if&lt;br /&gt;
he could but add these articles to&lt;br /&gt;
the list of his own productions, there&lt;br /&gt;
would be a great saving in the fa-&lt;br /&gt;
mily. Mrs. Bull too was pleased&lt;br /&gt;
with the idea of having her silk&lt;br /&gt;
gowns and ribbands of her own&lt;br /&gt;
growth, and with the expectation of&lt;br /&gt;
having the vaults filled with wine,&lt;br /&gt;
made on her own plantation; for&lt;br /&gt;
these and other good reasons, her&lt;br /&gt;
thereunto moving, madam gave her&lt;br /&gt;
consent to the project. The person&lt;br /&gt;
appointed to carry it into execution&lt;br /&gt;
was &lt;em&gt;George Trusty&lt;/em&gt;, ([^56]) a sensible&lt;br /&gt;
well-bred merchant, but one who&lt;br /&gt;
had only speculated in the science&lt;br /&gt;
of agriculture, and knew nothing&lt;br /&gt;
of it by experience. Having col-&lt;br /&gt;
lected a number of poor people who&lt;br /&gt;
were out of employment, he sent&lt;br /&gt;
them to the spot, with strict orders&lt;br /&gt;
to work fix days in seven, to keep&lt;br /&gt;
their tools free from rust, and their&lt;br /&gt;
fire-arms in readiness for their de-&lt;br /&gt;
fence; whatever they should earn&lt;br /&gt;
was to be their own as long as they&lt;br /&gt;
lived, and after their death their&lt;br /&gt;
possessions were to descend to their&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;sons&lt;/em&gt;, and in default of male issue&lt;br /&gt;
to revert to the original grantor.&lt;br /&gt;
They were not allowed to use black&lt;br /&gt;
cattle in the labour of the field;&lt;br /&gt;
and were expressly forbidden to&lt;br /&gt;
drink grog. Their business&lt;br /&gt;
was to cultivate vines and mulberry&lt;br /&gt;
trees, and to manufacture wine and&lt;br /&gt;
silk. Upon this project another&lt;br /&gt;
was grafted by the very sagacious&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Doctor Squintum&lt;/em&gt;, who chose this&lt;br /&gt;
new plantation as the most conve-&lt;br /&gt;
nient spot in the world for a charity&lt;br /&gt;
school, where &lt;em&gt;Orphans&lt;/em&gt; might re-&lt;br /&gt;
ceive the best education and be fit-&lt;br /&gt;
ted to be the pillars of church and&lt;br /&gt;
state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But notwithstanding the sums&lt;br /&gt;
which Bull so freely lavished out&lt;br /&gt;
of his bags for the support of the vine&lt;br /&gt;
and mulberry plantations; and not-&lt;br /&gt;
withstanding the collections which&lt;br /&gt;
Squintum made among his nume-&lt;br /&gt;
rous devotees, these projects were&lt;br /&gt;
either so impracticable in them-&lt;br /&gt;
selves, or so ill conducted in the ex-&lt;br /&gt;
ecution, that neither of them answer-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the expectations of the project-&lt;br /&gt;
ors. For want of black cattle the&lt;br /&gt;
soil could not be properly tilled,&lt;br /&gt;
and for want of grog the labourers&lt;br /&gt;
fainted at their work; the right of&lt;br /&gt;
inheritance being limited to the&lt;br /&gt;
male line, women and girls were&lt;br /&gt;
not fond of living there, and the&lt;br /&gt;
men could not well live without&lt;br /&gt;
them; land, cattle, women and&lt;br /&gt;
grog, were to be had elsewhere,&lt;br /&gt;
and who would be confined to such&lt;br /&gt;
a place? The land too, was claimed&lt;br /&gt;
by Lord Strut, who sent them&lt;br /&gt;
writs of ejectment. The Charity-&lt;br /&gt;
School dwindled to nothing and&lt;br /&gt;
was consumed by fire. Poor George&lt;br /&gt;
Trusty was discouraged and begged&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Bull to take the plantation in-&lt;br /&gt;
to his own hands, however Bull&lt;br /&gt;
kept supplying him with cash and&lt;br /&gt;
he kept making attempts. Altera-&lt;br /&gt;
tions were made in the terms of&lt;br /&gt;
settlement, the restrictions were re-&lt;br /&gt;
moved, cattle and grog were al-&lt;br /&gt;
lowed, Lord Strut was ousted&lt;br /&gt;
and possession held; the swamps&lt;br /&gt;
were drained; rice and indigo were&lt;br /&gt;
cultivated instead of silk and wine,&lt;br /&gt;
and upon the whole, considerable im-&lt;br /&gt;
provements were made, though at&lt;br /&gt;
such a vast expense that Mr. Bull&lt;br /&gt;
never saw any adequate returns.&lt;br /&gt;
The ill-success of this adventure,&lt;br /&gt;
did not deter him from another pro-&lt;br /&gt;
ject. He was extremely fond of &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Trout&lt;/em&gt; ([^57]) and thought if he could&lt;br /&gt;
have them regularly catched and&lt;br /&gt;
brought to his table, he should ex-&lt;br /&gt;
ceed all his neighbours in delicate&lt;br /&gt;
living, and now and then be able to&lt;br /&gt;
send a mess to his particular friends.&lt;br /&gt;
Lord Peter’s family too, he thought&lt;br /&gt;
would be glad to buy them as they&lt;br /&gt;
were very useful in the long lents,&lt;br /&gt;
and frequent meagre days observed by&lt;br /&gt;
them. There was a part of the&lt;br /&gt;
forest on the north-east quarter,&lt;br /&gt;
which was very conveniently situa-&lt;br /&gt;
ted for this employment. ([^58]) It&lt;br /&gt;
had been occupied by &lt;em&gt;Alexander *&lt;br /&gt;
*Scotus&lt;/em&gt;, a purblind fellow, who had&lt;br /&gt;
straggled thither no one could&lt;br /&gt;
tell how, and it was matter of&lt;br /&gt;
doubt whether he derived his right&lt;br /&gt;
from Bull or Lewis, for both of&lt;br /&gt;
them laid claim to the land, and&lt;br /&gt;
their claims had not been fairly&lt;br /&gt;
decided in law. To make sure of&lt;br /&gt;
the matter, Mr. Bull, by advice of&lt;br /&gt;
his wife, sent thither ([^59]) a parcel of&lt;br /&gt;
naked half starved people, who could&lt;br /&gt;
live no where else, and supported&lt;br /&gt;
them for several years with provisi-&lt;br /&gt;
ons, furnished them with skiffs,&lt;br /&gt;
lines, hooks and other implements&lt;br /&gt;
to carry on the fishery; but every&lt;br /&gt;
trout which they catched, cost him&lt;br /&gt;
ten times as much as if he had&lt;br /&gt;
bought it in the common market;&lt;br /&gt;
nor could he after all get half of&lt;br /&gt;
what he wanted for his own con-&lt;br /&gt;
sumption. His trout-fishery, and&lt;br /&gt;
his mulberry plantation, rendered&lt;br /&gt;
him the laughing-stock of his neigh-&lt;br /&gt;
bours, nor could he ever gain even&lt;br /&gt;
the interest of the money he had&lt;br /&gt;
laid out upon them; while the fo-&lt;br /&gt;
resters who had settled at their own&lt;br /&gt;
expense grew rich and became res-&lt;br /&gt;
pectable. He had indeed, the be-&lt;br /&gt;
nefit of their trade, which kept his&lt;br /&gt;
journeymen at work, and obliged&lt;br /&gt;
him to enlarge their number; for&lt;br /&gt;
the foresters had a respect for their&lt;br /&gt;
old master and landlord, and when&lt;br /&gt;
they had any thing to sell they al-&lt;br /&gt;
ways let him have the refusal of it,&lt;br /&gt;
and bought all their goods of him.&lt;br /&gt;
But though he called himself their&lt;br /&gt;
father, and his wife their mother,&lt;br /&gt;
yet it is thought he never entertain-&lt;br /&gt;
ed a proper parental affection for&lt;br /&gt;
them; but rather looked on them&lt;br /&gt;
with a jealous eye, as if they were&lt;br /&gt;
aiming to deprive him of his claim&lt;br /&gt;
and set up for independence. Had&lt;br /&gt;
he been contented with the profits&lt;br /&gt;
of their trade, as was certainly his&lt;br /&gt;
interest, they might have remained&lt;br /&gt;
his tenants to this day; but ambi-&lt;br /&gt;
tion, avarice, jealousy and choler,&lt;br /&gt;
inflamed by bad counsellors, have&lt;br /&gt;
wrought such a separation, that it&lt;br /&gt;
is thought Mr. Bull will go mourning&lt;br /&gt;
all the remainder of his days, and&lt;br /&gt;
his grey hairs will be brought down&lt;br /&gt;
with sorrow to the grave.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;To be continued.&lt;/em&gt;]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[8. February 1788]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FORESTERS,\&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An&lt;/em&gt; AMERICAN TALE, *being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clothier.*&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Continued from&lt;/em&gt; vol. i. &lt;em&gt;page&lt;/em&gt; 793.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the preceding part of this his-&lt;br /&gt;
tory we have endeavoured, to trace&lt;br /&gt;
the several steps by which the forest be-&lt;br /&gt;
came cultivated and peopled. Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Bull had no less than fourteen tenants&lt;br /&gt;
who held under him, and were settled&lt;br /&gt;
on lands which he claimed as his own,&lt;br /&gt;
and which he had granted to them in&lt;br /&gt;
separate parcels. Their names were as&lt;br /&gt;
follows, beginning at the north-east, and&lt;br /&gt;
proceeding to the south-west:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alexander Scotus, N. S.\&lt;br /&gt;
Robert Lumber, N. H.\&lt;br /&gt;
John Codline, M.\&lt;br /&gt;
Roger Carrier, R. I.\&lt;br /&gt;
Humphrey Plough-share, C.\&lt;br /&gt;
Peter Bull-Frog, N. Y.\&lt;br /&gt;
Julius Caesar, N. J.\&lt;br /&gt;
—- Casimir, D.\&lt;br /&gt;
William Broad-brim, P.\&lt;br /&gt;
Frederick Mary-gold, M.\&lt;br /&gt;
Walter Pipe-weed, V.\&lt;br /&gt;
Peter Pitch, N. C.\&lt;br /&gt;
Charles Indigo, S. C.\&lt;br /&gt;
George Trusty, G.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was observed, that of all the ad-&lt;br /&gt;
venturers, those generally were the&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;least thriving&lt;/em&gt;, who received &lt;em&gt;most assist- *&lt;br /&gt;
*ance&lt;/em&gt; from their old master. Whether&lt;br /&gt;
it was owing to their being employed&lt;br /&gt;
in business to which they had not serv-&lt;br /&gt;
ed a regular apprentice-ship, or to a&lt;br /&gt;
natural indolence, and a disposition to&lt;br /&gt;
continue hangers-on where they had&lt;br /&gt;
got a good hold; for it must be noted,&lt;br /&gt;
that Mr. Bull was very generous to&lt;br /&gt;
some persons, and on some occasions&lt;br /&gt;
where it suited his fancy, and this dis-&lt;br /&gt;
position in him was so prevalent, that&lt;br /&gt;
they who kenned him, and would hu-&lt;br /&gt;
mor his whims, could work him out&lt;br /&gt;
of any thing which they had a mind&lt;br /&gt;
to [sic]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, those adventu-&lt;br /&gt;
rers who came into the forest on their&lt;br /&gt;
own hook, and had no assistance at all&lt;br /&gt;
from their old master, nor any thing to&lt;br /&gt;
help themselves with, but their own&lt;br /&gt;
heads and hands, proved to be the most&lt;br /&gt;
industrious and thriving, and after a&lt;br /&gt;
while told up a good estate. They all&lt;br /&gt;
seemed to have an affection for Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Bull, and it was generally believed&lt;br /&gt;
to be sincere. His house was usually&lt;br /&gt;
spoken of by them as their &lt;em&gt;home&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
His ware-house was the center of their&lt;br /&gt;
traffic; and he had the address to en-&lt;br /&gt;
gross the profits of their labour and&lt;br /&gt;
draw their earnings into his own fob.&lt;br /&gt;
To some of them he would now and&lt;br /&gt;
then make a present, to others he would&lt;br /&gt;
lend a ([^60]) pack of his hounds when he&lt;br /&gt;
was out of the humor of hunting;&lt;br /&gt;
but they were generally useless to&lt;br /&gt;
them for the purpose of scouring the&lt;br /&gt;
woods, those who could afford it kept&lt;br /&gt;
dogs of their own, who were better&lt;br /&gt;
trained to the game, and could better&lt;br /&gt;
scent the forest, being native curs, and&lt;br /&gt;
not so spruce and delicate a breed as&lt;br /&gt;
Bull’s grey-hounds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has been before observed, that&lt;br /&gt;
each end of the forest was occupied&lt;br /&gt;
by Bull’s rivals. His old neighbour&lt;br /&gt;
Lewis had got the north end, and&lt;br /&gt;
Lord Strut the south. Bull’s tenants had&lt;br /&gt;
seated themselves chiefly on or near&lt;br /&gt;
the shore of the lake, and had not ex-&lt;br /&gt;
tended very far back, because of the&lt;br /&gt;
beasts of prey; but Lewis, like a cun-&lt;br /&gt;
ning old fox, had formed a scheme to get&lt;br /&gt;
footing in the interior parts of the&lt;br /&gt;
country, and prevent these planters&lt;br /&gt;
from penetrating beyond the limits&lt;br /&gt;
which he intended to assign them. His&lt;br /&gt;
emissaries had been sent slyly into the&lt;br /&gt;
distant parts of the forest, under pre-&lt;br /&gt;
tence of taming these beasts of prey;&lt;br /&gt;
but in fact they had halved the matter&lt;br /&gt;
with them, and had themselves become&lt;br /&gt;
as savage as the beasts had become&lt;br /&gt;
tame. They would run, leap and&lt;br /&gt;
climb with them and crawl into their&lt;br /&gt;
dens, imparting to them a lick of &lt;em&gt;me- *&lt;br /&gt;
*lasses&lt;/em&gt; out of their calabash, and teaching&lt;br /&gt;
them to scratch with their paws the&lt;br /&gt;
sign of a cross. They had built several&lt;br /&gt;
hunting lodges on the most convenient&lt;br /&gt;
passes of the brooks and ponds,&lt;br /&gt;
and though thus scattered in the wood,&lt;br /&gt;
were all united under one overseer,&lt;br /&gt;
called ([^61]) &lt;em&gt;Onontio&lt;/em&gt;, who lived in the&lt;br /&gt;
mansion-house of &lt;em&gt;St. Lewis&lt;/em&gt;’s Hall.&lt;br /&gt;
It was matter of wonder among&lt;br /&gt;
Bull’s tenants, for some time, what&lt;br /&gt;
could be the reason that the wild beasts&lt;br /&gt;
had grown more surly and snappish&lt;br /&gt;
of late than formerly; but after a&lt;br /&gt;
while, some hunters made a discovery&lt;br /&gt;
of the new lodges, which the emissa-&lt;br /&gt;
ries of Onontio had erected, and the&lt;br /&gt;
design of them being apparent, a gene-&lt;br /&gt;
ral alarm was raised in the plantations.&lt;br /&gt;
On the first news, Walter Pipe-weed&lt;br /&gt;
sent his grandson ([^62]) &lt;em&gt;George&lt;/em&gt;, a smart,&lt;br /&gt;
active, lively youth, across the hills,&lt;br /&gt;
with his compliments to the intruders,&lt;br /&gt;
desiring them to move off, and threat-&lt;br /&gt;
ening them with a writ in case of non-&lt;br /&gt;
compliance. This modest warning be-&lt;br /&gt;
ing ineffectual, it was thought that if&lt;br /&gt;
an &lt;em&gt;Union&lt;/em&gt; could be formed among the&lt;br /&gt;
tenants, they might make a stand a-&lt;br /&gt;
gainst these encroachments. A meet-&lt;br /&gt;
ing was held at ([^63]) &lt;em&gt;Orange-Hall&lt;/em&gt;, but&lt;br /&gt;
no efficient plan could be hit on, with-&lt;br /&gt;
out a previous application to their land-&lt;br /&gt;
lord, who hearing of this meeting,&lt;br /&gt;
conceived a jealousy with regard to this&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;union&lt;/em&gt; which seemed to be their object,&lt;br /&gt;
and thought it was better to retain the&lt;br /&gt;
management of the matter in his own&lt;br /&gt;
hands, and keep them divided among&lt;br /&gt;
themselves, but united in their depend-&lt;br /&gt;
ence on him. He therefore sent them&lt;br /&gt;
word that “he had a very great affect-&lt;br /&gt;
“ tion for them, and would take care&lt;br /&gt;
“ of &lt;em&gt;their&lt;/em&gt; interest, which was also &lt;em&gt;his *&lt;br /&gt;
“ *own&lt;/em&gt;; that he would not suffer old&lt;br /&gt;
“ Lewis to set his half-tamed wild&lt;br /&gt;
“ beasts upon them, nor eject them&lt;br /&gt;
“ from their possessions, but that he&lt;br /&gt;
“ would immediately take advice of&lt;br /&gt;
“ his council, learned in the law, con-&lt;br /&gt;
“ juring them by the affection which&lt;br /&gt;
“ they professed to bear towards him,&lt;br /&gt;
“ to be aiding and assisting in all ways,&lt;br /&gt;
“ in their power towards bringing the&lt;br /&gt;
“ controversy to an issue.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this time, the Steward, to whom&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Bull entrusted the care of his bus-&lt;br /&gt;
iness, was not a person of that discern-&lt;br /&gt;
ment and expedition which the exigen-&lt;br /&gt;
cy of affairs required. He had com-&lt;br /&gt;
mitted divers blunders in his accounts,&lt;br /&gt;
and it was suspected that he was a de-&lt;br /&gt;
faulter in more respects than one. It&lt;br /&gt;
cannot, therefore, be expected, that in&lt;br /&gt;
conducting a controversy of this mag-&lt;br /&gt;
nitude, he should exactly hit on the&lt;br /&gt;
right methods, nor employ the best&lt;br /&gt;
council which could be had. The&lt;br /&gt;
first step which was taken was to send &lt;br /&gt;
([^64]) &lt;em&gt;Broad-oak&lt;/em&gt; the bailiff, with a writ&lt;br /&gt;
of intrusion which he was ordered to&lt;br /&gt;
serve &lt;em&gt;volens nolens&lt;/em&gt; upon one of the&lt;br /&gt;
messuages or hunting-seats of Lewis.&lt;br /&gt;
This bailiff proceeding rashly and a-&lt;br /&gt;
gainst the best advice into the forest,&lt;br /&gt;
not a step of which he was acquainted&lt;br /&gt;
with, found his progress impeded in a&lt;br /&gt;
way wholly unexpected. For Onontio&lt;br /&gt;
had taken care to place a number of&lt;br /&gt;
his half tamed wild cats and wolverenes&lt;br /&gt;
on the boughs of trees, which hung&lt;br /&gt;
over the path, and as soon as the bailiff&lt;br /&gt;
came within reach, having first wetted&lt;br /&gt;
their tails with their own urine, they&lt;br /&gt;
whisked it into his eyes till they blind-&lt;br /&gt;
ed him. This manoeuvre put a stop to&lt;br /&gt;
the process for that time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Several other attempts of the like&lt;br /&gt;
kind were made without success, and&lt;br /&gt;
Lewis at one time had almost got pos-&lt;br /&gt;
session of ([^65]) &lt;em&gt;Orange-Hall&lt;/em&gt;. Not only&lt;br /&gt;
the foresters themselves, but even&lt;br /&gt;
Bull’s own domestics, complained bitter-&lt;br /&gt;
ly of these ineffectual measures, and&lt;br /&gt;
their clamors at last prevailed to&lt;br /&gt;
make him discharge his old steward,&lt;br /&gt;
and put another into his place. The&lt;br /&gt;
new ([^66]) officer soon changed the face&lt;br /&gt;
of affairs; he employed no attorneys,&lt;br /&gt;
nor bailiffs, but those of tried and ap-&lt;br /&gt;
proved abilities, men of enterprize and&lt;br /&gt;
resolution, by whom the suit was pro-&lt;br /&gt;
secuted in good earnest. In every ac-&lt;br /&gt;
tion Bull recovered judgment, and got&lt;br /&gt;
possession. When Lord Strut came in&lt;br /&gt;
to the aid of Lewis, Bull cast him also,&lt;br /&gt;
and took away his manor of Augustine,&lt;br /&gt;
which with the whole tract of land,&lt;br /&gt;
where Onontio presided, was annexed&lt;br /&gt;
to his estate. The agents who had&lt;br /&gt;
been employed in this arduous service,&lt;br /&gt;
were not only well paid for doing their&lt;br /&gt;
duty, but, with the steward, who em-&lt;br /&gt;
ployed them, were honored according&lt;br /&gt;
to the ancient, but whimsical custom of&lt;br /&gt;
Bull’s family, by having their effigies&lt;br /&gt;
portrayed on sign-boards, pocket-&lt;br /&gt;
handkerchiefs, snuff-boxes, and punch-&lt;br /&gt;
bowls; so that while the fit lasted, you&lt;br /&gt;
could not walk the streets, nor blow&lt;br /&gt;
your nose, nor take a pinch of snuff,&lt;br /&gt;
nor a draught of punch, but you were&lt;br /&gt;
obliged to &lt;em&gt;salute&lt;/em&gt; them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever Bull’s steward called up-&lt;br /&gt;
on the foresters for their quotas of aid,&lt;br /&gt;
towards carrying on this heavy law-&lt;br /&gt;
suit, they always readily afforded it;&lt;br /&gt;
and some of them were really almost&lt;br /&gt;
exhausted by the efforts which they&lt;br /&gt;
made, to do &lt;em&gt;more&lt;/em&gt; than their share. The&lt;br /&gt;
steward was so sensible of their merit,&lt;br /&gt;
that on due consultation with Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Bull’s wife, and her taking him in the&lt;br /&gt;
right mood, he was prevailed upon to&lt;br /&gt;
reimburse the extra expense to them,&lt;br /&gt;
and mutual complacency reigned be-&lt;br /&gt;
tween the landlord and tenants all the&lt;br /&gt;
time this steward remained in office.&lt;br /&gt;
But these times were too good to last&lt;br /&gt;
long; there were some who envied&lt;br /&gt;
him his reputation, and raised stories&lt;br /&gt;
to his disadvantage, which highly af-&lt;br /&gt;
fronted him. At this time Mr.&lt;br /&gt;
Bull was so much off his guard, as to give&lt;br /&gt;
heed to these reports, and take a rash&lt;br /&gt;
step in a hurry, which he had occasion&lt;br /&gt;
to repent of at his leisure. He accept-&lt;br /&gt;
ed the resignation of this trusty ser-&lt;br /&gt;
vant, and put one of his ([^67]) sister&lt;br /&gt;
Peg’s cast-off footmen into his place;&lt;br /&gt;
whereby he laid a foundation for his&lt;br /&gt;
own disgrace, and the dismemberment&lt;br /&gt;
of his estate, as the reader will see&lt;br /&gt;
in the following pages of this history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;To be continued&lt;/em&gt;.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[9. April 1788]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The FORESTERS,\&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;An&lt;/em&gt; AMERICAN TALE, &lt;em&gt;being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the
Clothier.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;em&gt;Continued from page&lt;/em&gt; 60.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TO trace with precision all the&lt;br /&gt;
causes, great and small, which&lt;br /&gt;
operated to the dismemberment of&lt;br /&gt;
John Bull’s estate, would be no&lt;br /&gt;
easy task; some of them perhaps,&lt;br /&gt;
were &lt;em&gt;secret&lt;/em&gt;, but of such, as were open&lt;br /&gt;
to observation, we shall endeavour&lt;br /&gt;
to sketch out the principal.&lt;br /&gt;
It is well known, that he was of a&lt;br /&gt;
choleric habit, and that those who&lt;br /&gt;
were acquainted with his humour and&lt;br /&gt;
passions, could manage and impose&lt;br /&gt;
upon him at their pleasure. Had&lt;br /&gt;
he been let alone to pursue his own&lt;br /&gt;
business &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt;, his plain, natural&lt;br /&gt;
good sense, and generosity of mind,&lt;br /&gt;
would have kept him clear of many&lt;br /&gt;
difficulties; but he had his advisers,&lt;br /&gt;
his hangers-on, his levee-hunters,&lt;br /&gt;
his toad-eaters, and sycophants, for-&lt;br /&gt;
ever about him, who, like a parcel&lt;br /&gt;
of blood-suckers, could never have&lt;br /&gt;
enough to glut their voracity.&lt;br /&gt;
When the forest was first occupied&lt;br /&gt;
by the tenants, Bull had a ([^68]) wife&lt;br /&gt;
who minded her own domestic busi-&lt;br /&gt;
ness, and did not concern herself&lt;br /&gt;
with his landed interest. The&lt;br /&gt;
leases and grants were made out in &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;his&lt;/em&gt; name, and he was supposed to&lt;br /&gt;
be the owner or proprietor; but&lt;br /&gt;
the lady whom he now had, was very&lt;br /&gt;
assuming, and insisted on having&lt;br /&gt;
her hand in the management of &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
his affairs. She visited the compt-&lt;br /&gt;
ing-house, and made the clerks&lt;br /&gt;
shew her their books; she over-&lt;br /&gt;
haled the steward’s accounts,&lt;br /&gt;
and inspected his correspondence;&lt;br /&gt;
she not only looked after the rents&lt;br /&gt;
and incomes of the forest, but even&lt;br /&gt;
intruded into the household concerns&lt;br /&gt;
of the tenants, and affected to call&lt;br /&gt;
herself &lt;em&gt;their mother&lt;/em&gt;, because she had&lt;br /&gt;
taken some care of one or two of&lt;br /&gt;
them in their first setting out, al-&lt;br /&gt;
though most of them scarcely ever&lt;br /&gt;
had seen her face, or had any ac-&lt;br /&gt;
quaintance with her, but by hearsay.&lt;br /&gt;
It must be observed, also, that&lt;br /&gt;
this woman had engaged Mr. Bull&lt;br /&gt;
in some expensive lawsuits, and&lt;br /&gt;
speculations, which had got him&lt;br /&gt;
deeply into &lt;em&gt;debt&lt;/em&gt;, and he was obliged&lt;br /&gt;
to hire money of usurers to carry&lt;br /&gt;
her schemes into execution. Had&lt;br /&gt;
she, at the same time, introduced that&lt;br /&gt;
frugality and economy into the fa-&lt;br /&gt;
mily, which her duty ought to have&lt;br /&gt;
prompted her to, this debt might&lt;br /&gt;
have been kept down, and the in-&lt;br /&gt;
terest regularly paid; but the swarm&lt;br /&gt;
of harpies which were continually&lt;br /&gt;
about her, and the course of gamb-&lt;br /&gt;
ling which was carried on under her&lt;br /&gt;
connivance and direction, swallowed&lt;br /&gt;
up all the profits of the trade, and&lt;br /&gt;
incomes of the land, while the lux-&lt;br /&gt;
ury and dissipation of the family in-&lt;br /&gt;
creased in proportion, as the means&lt;br /&gt;
of discharging the debt decreased.&lt;br /&gt;
In short, Mr. Bull was reduced to&lt;br /&gt;
that humiliating condition, which,&lt;br /&gt;
by whatever fashionable name it may&lt;br /&gt;
now go, was formerly called &lt;em&gt;petti-&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;coat-government&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the law-suit with Lewis&lt;br /&gt;
and Lord Strut ([^69]) concerning the&lt;br /&gt;
forest, there had been a great inter-&lt;br /&gt;
course with the tenants. Many of&lt;br /&gt;
Bull’s servants and retainers, who&lt;br /&gt;
were employed as bailiffs and attor-&lt;br /&gt;
nies, and their deputies, had been&lt;br /&gt;
very conversant with them, and&lt;br /&gt;
were entertained at their houses,&lt;br /&gt;
where they always found whol-&lt;br /&gt;
esome victuals, jolly fire sides, and&lt;br /&gt;
warm beds. They took much no-&lt;br /&gt;
tice of every thing that passed, ask-&lt;br /&gt;
ed many questions, and made many&lt;br /&gt;
remarks on the goodness of the&lt;br /&gt;
land, the pleasant situation of the&lt;br /&gt;
houses, the clean and thriving con-&lt;br /&gt;
dition of the children, who were al-&lt;br /&gt;
ways ready to wait them, to&lt;br /&gt;
clean their boots, hold their stir-&lt;br /&gt;
rups, open and shut the gates for&lt;br /&gt;
them, and the like little necessary&lt;br /&gt;
services, as well bred children in the&lt;br /&gt;
country are wont. The remarks&lt;br /&gt;
which these persons made, when&lt;br /&gt;
they got home, favored rather of&lt;br /&gt;
envy, than of gratitude or affection.&lt;br /&gt;
Some of them would say “Those&lt;br /&gt;
fellows live too well in the forest;&lt;br /&gt;
they thrive too fast; the place is&lt;br /&gt;
too good for them; they ought to&lt;br /&gt;
know who is their master; they&lt;br /&gt;
can afford to pay more rent;&lt;br /&gt;
they ought to pay for the help they&lt;br /&gt;
have had; if it had not been for&lt;br /&gt;
Master Bull, and the assistance which&lt;br /&gt;
he has lent them, they would have&lt;br /&gt;
been turned out of doors; and now&lt;br /&gt;
they are to reap the benefit of his&lt;br /&gt;
exertions, while he (poor man) is&lt;br /&gt;
to pay the cost.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were not wanting some, in&lt;br /&gt;
the families of the Foresters them-&lt;br /&gt;
selves, who had the meanness to&lt;br /&gt;
crouch to these fellows, and suppli-&lt;br /&gt;
cate their favour and interest with&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Bull, to recommend them to&lt;br /&gt;
some posts of profit, as under-stew-&lt;br /&gt;
ards, collectors of rent, clerks of&lt;br /&gt;
receipts, and the like pretty offices.&lt;br /&gt;
These beggarly curs would repeat&lt;br /&gt;
the same language, and hold corres-&lt;br /&gt;
pondence with the bailiffs, attornies,&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;amp;c. after they had got home.&lt;br /&gt;
Whenever any trifling quarrel hap-&lt;br /&gt;
pened in the families of the tenants,&lt;br /&gt;
they would magnify it and fill their&lt;br /&gt;
letters with complaints of the licen-&lt;br /&gt;
tiousness of the people, and plead&lt;br /&gt;
for a tighter hand to be held over&lt;br /&gt;
them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such speeches as those were fre-&lt;br /&gt;
quently made, and such letters read,&lt;br /&gt;
in the hearing of Mr. Bull’s wife&lt;br /&gt;
and steward. This grew by degrees&lt;br /&gt;
to be the current language of the&lt;br /&gt;
family, and Bull himself listened to&lt;br /&gt;
it. His choler rose upon the occa-&lt;br /&gt;
sion, and when his hangers-on ob-&lt;br /&gt;
served it, they plied him with strong-&lt;br /&gt;
er doses, till his jealousy and hatred&lt;br /&gt;
were excited, and a complete revo-&lt;br /&gt;
lution in his temper, with regard&lt;br /&gt;
to his tenants, took place, agreea-&lt;br /&gt;
bly to the most sanguine and male-&lt;br /&gt;
volent wishes of his and their ene-&lt;br /&gt;
mies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first effect of this change&lt;br /&gt;
was, that his clerks were ordered&lt;br /&gt;
to charge not only the prices of the&lt;br /&gt;
goods, which the tenants should&lt;br /&gt;
purchase, but to make them pay&lt;br /&gt;
for the &lt;em&gt;paper&lt;/em&gt; ([^70]) on which their&lt;br /&gt;
bills of parcels and notes of hand&lt;br /&gt;
were written, and that at a very&lt;br /&gt;
exorbitant rate. This was so into-&lt;br /&gt;
lerable an abuse, and withal so mean,&lt;br /&gt;
pitiful, and beggarly an expedient&lt;br /&gt;
to pick their pockets, that they&lt;br /&gt;
held a meeting among themselves,&lt;br /&gt;
and resolved not to buy any more&lt;br /&gt;
of his goods, as long as this impo-&lt;br /&gt;
sition lasted; and by way of con-&lt;br /&gt;
tempt, they hanged and burned the&lt;br /&gt;
effigies of the steward, and other&lt;br /&gt;
persons who were suspected of hav-&lt;br /&gt;
ing advised to these new measures.&lt;br /&gt;
The resentment shewn by the te-&lt;br /&gt;
nants on this occasion was quite un-&lt;br /&gt;
expected. The secret favourers, and&lt;br /&gt;
real authors of the mischief, began&lt;br /&gt;
to be afraid that they had gone too&lt;br /&gt;
far for the first attempt. Bull’s&lt;br /&gt;
journeymen were in an uproar about&lt;br /&gt;
it, left by the failure of his trade&lt;br /&gt;
they should be out of bread; and&lt;br /&gt;
to shorten the story, he was obliged&lt;br /&gt;
to give up the point of making&lt;br /&gt;
them pay for the paper, though &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Madam&lt;/em&gt; had the singular modesty to&lt;br /&gt;
make a declaration, that it was a&lt;br /&gt;
mere matter of &lt;em&gt;expediency&lt;/em&gt;, and that&lt;br /&gt;
SHE had the sole power and right&lt;br /&gt;
of dominion over them, notwith-&lt;br /&gt;
standing Mr. Bull’s &lt;em&gt;most gracious&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
concession at that time. ([^71])&lt;br /&gt;
This was considered by the te-&lt;br /&gt;
nants as a most impudent and bare-&lt;br /&gt;
faced assumption; for whatever&lt;br /&gt;
rights Mr. Bull might pretend to&lt;br /&gt;
have, as their old master and land-&lt;br /&gt;
lord, yet they never had any idea&lt;br /&gt;
of a &lt;em&gt;mistress&lt;/em&gt; over them; and though&lt;br /&gt;
they very complaisantly returned&lt;br /&gt;
him their thanks for his present&lt;br /&gt;
goodness, yet as they suspected&lt;br /&gt;
that there was more mischief hatch-&lt;br /&gt;
ing, they began to enquire more&lt;br /&gt;
narrowly than ever into his right&lt;br /&gt;
and title to the land, on which they&lt;br /&gt;
lived. They looked over old parch-&lt;br /&gt;
ments and memorandums, consulted&lt;br /&gt;
council learned in the law, and after&lt;br /&gt;
due deliberation, they were fully&lt;br /&gt;
convinced, that &lt;em&gt;their own&lt;/em&gt; title was,&lt;br /&gt;
at least, as good as his, and that&lt;br /&gt;
they had a right to refuse him any&lt;br /&gt;
rent or acknowledgment, if it were&lt;br /&gt;
prudent for them to exercise it.&lt;br /&gt;
Mr . Bull’s jealousy was now en-&lt;br /&gt;
creased with regard to their intenti-&lt;br /&gt;
ons, and his scribbling retainers&lt;br /&gt;
frequently accused them of ingrate-&lt;br /&gt;
tude and disobedience, and a long pre-&lt;br /&gt;
meditated design to set up for inde-&lt;br /&gt;
pendence; a thing which they had&lt;br /&gt;
not yet thought of, and probably&lt;br /&gt;
never would, if this abusive treat-&lt;br /&gt;
ment had not put it into their heads.&lt;br /&gt;
But though by those means they&lt;br /&gt;
were led into an enquiry, and a train&lt;br /&gt;
of thinking, which were quite new&lt;br /&gt;
to them; yet as old habits are not&lt;br /&gt;
easily broken, and their affection for&lt;br /&gt;
their master was very strong, they&lt;br /&gt;
endeavoured, with a candor which&lt;br /&gt;
did them honor, to transfer the&lt;br /&gt;
blame from him to his wife and&lt;br /&gt;
steward, to whose machinations they&lt;br /&gt;
knew he was a dupe. These bad&lt;br /&gt;
counsellors soon renewed their at-&lt;br /&gt;
tempts in another shape, by raising&lt;br /&gt;
the rent, and putting an advanced&lt;br /&gt;
price upon the goods, and by means&lt;br /&gt;
of additional clerks, packers, por-&lt;br /&gt;
ters, watchmen, draymen, &amp;amp;c. who&lt;br /&gt;
were continually in waiting, and&lt;br /&gt;
to all of whom fees were to be paid,&lt;br /&gt;
the trade laboured under great em-&lt;br /&gt;
barrassments, and some of the Fo-&lt;br /&gt;
resters were quite discouraged, others&lt;br /&gt;
were vexed and impatient, while&lt;br /&gt;
some of the better tempered of them,&lt;br /&gt;
endeavoured to persuade the rest to&lt;br /&gt;
keep up the communication as long&lt;br /&gt;
as they could. They were loth to&lt;br /&gt;
quarrel with their old master, and&lt;br /&gt;
yet could not pocket the affronts&lt;br /&gt;
and abuses to which they were daily&lt;br /&gt;
exposed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this sullen interval, many&lt;br /&gt;
letters passed, many books and pre-&lt;br /&gt;
cedents were examined, and much&lt;br /&gt;
ink was shed, in a controversy,&lt;br /&gt;
which, however incapable of a &lt;em&gt;deci- *&lt;br /&gt;
*sion&lt;/em&gt; in this way, might have been&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;em&gt;compromised&lt;/em&gt;, if Mr. Bull’s first&lt;br /&gt;
thoughts had been as good as his&lt;br /&gt;
second; but he was so completely&lt;br /&gt;
under management, as not to see&lt;br /&gt;
his true interest. It was a common&lt;br /&gt;
saying among his neighbors, “John&lt;br /&gt;
Bull’s wit comes afterward;” and&lt;br /&gt;
in fact it did not come in this case,&lt;br /&gt;
till too late, for, when a cause once&lt;br /&gt;
gets into the law, there are so many&lt;br /&gt;
quirks, evasions, demurs, and procras-&lt;br /&gt;
tinations, that it is impossible to&lt;br /&gt;
make a retreat, till one or both of&lt;br /&gt;
the parties have severely smarted&lt;br /&gt;
for their temerity.&lt;/p&gt;
