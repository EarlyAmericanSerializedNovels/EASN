<h3 id="preface">Preface</h3>

<p>The <em>Columbian Magazine</em> was one of the most successful early American magazines. It was founded by Mathew Carey, Charles Cist, Thomas Seddon, William Spotswood, and John Trenchard. The first issue of the magazine was published in September of 1786 and the magazine ran until 1792. The editors included the initial founders as well as, at various times, Francis Hopkinson, James Dallas, and an anonymous “society of gentlemen.” It had the largest circulation of eighteenth-century American magazines, with 1,500 subscribers.</p>

<p>It notably included fiction, as this was unusual at that time. Most issues had two or three stories, all of which were written and published anonymously. As Frank Luther Mott explains, these fictional stories ranged widely, including “oriental tales, allegories, characters, moral ‘novels,’ or ‘fragments” (96). The magazine also contained travel writing, such as descriptions of less commonly known American regions, as well as the types of essay series common to many magazines. According to Jared Gardner, the magazine “sought to create not an ephemeral periodical production but a lasting monument upon which a national literary culture might be built” (82). This fiction was often, as with both <em>The Foresters</em> and a “fragment” piece entitled <em>Shipwreck</em>, written as a transparent allegory for the new nation.</p>

<p>The magazine often focused on agriculture and mechanics, for instance an illustrated description of John Fitch’s steamboat. It later began to focus more on biography and history. For instance, Jeremy Belknap wrote biographical sketches that were later collected into a single volume. The magazine’s contributors also discussed educational methods.</p>

<p>The <em>Columbian</em> notably published historical articles, including a history of the Revolution. In its later guise of the <em>Universal Asylum and Columbian Magazine</em>, begun in January 1790, it focused on presenting narratives and documents about the history of the Revolutionary War. Once renamed to the <em>Universal Asylum and Columbian Magazine</em>, an anonymous “Society of Gentlemen” published it. It had fewer illustrations at this point, although it was still engraved by Thackara and Vallance.</p>

<p>In this version, it continued to be printed for almost three years, and sometimes these issues proved popular enough to warrant a printing of a second edition. The magazine was discontinued in 1792. According to <em>A History of American Magazines</em>, this was due to “the difficulties afforded by the new postoffice law of that year” rather than a lack of public interest or subscribers.</p>

<p>According to <em>Literature Criticism from 1400 to 1800</em>, Belknap initially published <em>The Foresters</em> anonymously. Although it sold well and circulated widely, and William Cullent Bryant praised it in a review, its initial public did not know <em>The Foresters</em>’ authorship. They did likely recognize its debt to John Arbuthnot’s <em>History of John Bull</em>, which was published in 1712.</p>

<p><em>The Foresters</em> was partially serialized in the magazine from its June 1787 issue to its April 1788 issue. The novel’s publication frequency was monthly for most of its serialization, although the final few installments were instead spaced two months apart. The novel subsequently was later twice published as a self-contained book, first in 1792 and again in 1796.</p>

<p><em>The Foresters</em> presents an atypical and satirical allegory for the founding of such a recently independent nation. As Gardner assert, <em>The Foresters</em> “uses allegory and satire to argue for natural hierarchy and the need for a strong federal government” (83). While this is true, it is worth emphasizing that each colony is characterized differently. All are given male personas, and the collection bursts with diverse economic, religious, and temperamental dispositions. Some have better relationships with John Bull than others. Native Americans are only somewhat depicted as varied amongst themselves. All the indigenous cultures and nations lumped together and depicted as “wild beasts,” with some individual beasts lured into civilization through their desire for molasses.</p>

<p>Rather than manufacturing a simple unity through similarity or nationalist fellow-feeling, the installments in <em>Columbia</em> magazine conclude with an emergent recognition of shared mistreatment rather than innate affinity. These foresters recognize themselves as an emergent unit in relation to John Bull rather than recognizing an overriding similarity among themselves. By presenting less a foundational mythology of noble aspirations than a satirical, at times even coarsely comedic tale focusing on material and cultural concerns, Belknap’s novel emphasizes the many aspects of difference, discord, and disagreement among its characters as much as it does shared situation and fellow-feeling. The foresters’ turn toward unification seems very reluctant and a direct effect of their collective mistreatment by John Bull. Belknap depicts the emergent country arising from a situational adherence rather than an innate national coherence.</p>

<p>[1. June 1787]</p>

<p>THE FORESTERS,\
<em>An</em> AMERICAN TALE, <em>being a Sequel to the History of</em> JOHN BULL, <em>the
Clothier.</em></p>

<p>EVERY one who has read the<br />
history of <em>John Bull</em>, the<br />
clothier, must have observed, that<br />
though “he was in the main an ho-<br />
nest, plain dealing fellow, yet he<br />
was choleric and inconstant, and ve-<br />
ry apt to quarrel with his best<br />
friends.” This observation we shall<br />
find fully verified in the course of<br />
the following narrative; and as the<br />
opinions and manners of superiors<br />
have a very great influence in form-<br />
ing the character of inferiors, we<br />
need not be surprized if we find a<br />
family likeness prevailing among the<br />
persons whose history we are about<br />
to recite, most, of whom were form-<br />
erly residents in Mr. Bull’s house,<br />
or apprentices in his shop.</p>

<p>There was among the appen-<br />
dages to John’s estate, a pretty large<br />
tract of land, which had been ne-<br />
glected by his ancestors, and which<br />
he never cared much about, except-<br />
ing that now and then some of his<br />
family went thither a-hunting, and<br />
brought home venison and furs. In-<br />
deed this was as far as I can find the<br />
best pretence that John had to call<br />
the land his; for he had no legal<br />
title to it. It was then a very woody<br />
country, in some parts rocky and<br />
hilly, in other parts level; well wa-<br />
tered with brooks and ponds, and<br />
the whole of it bordered on a large<br />
lake, in which were plenty of fish,<br />
some of which were often served up<br />
at John’s table, on fast-days.<br />
The stories told by one and an-<br />
other of these adventurers, had made<br />
a deep impression on the mind of <br />
<em>Walter Pipe-Weed</em> (<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup> ) one of John’s<br />
domestics, a fellow of a roving and<br />
projecting disposition, and who had<br />
learned the art of surveying. Walter<br />
having frequently listened to their<br />
chat, began to think within him-<br />
self, “If these fellows make so ma-<br />
ny pence by their excursions to this<br />
wild spot, what might not I gain<br />
by sitting down upon it ? There is<br />
plenty of game and fish at hand, for<br />
a present supply; plenty of nuts<br />
and acorns to fatten pigs, and with<br />
some small labour I may be able<br />
to raise corn and feed poultry, which<br />
will fetch me a good price at mar-<br />
ket.–I can carry bisket enough in<br />
my pockets, to keep me alive till my<br />
first crop comes in, and my dog can<br />
live upon the offals of the game that<br />
I shall kill.–Besides, who knows<br />
what treasures the land itself may<br />
contain–perhaps some rich mines !<br />
–od zounds!–then I am made for<br />
this world.”</p>

<p>Full of this dream, Walter ap-<br />
plied to his master one day for a<br />
lease of part of <em>the forest</em>, as it was<br />
called. Bull at first laughed at the<br />
proposal, and put him off; but Wal-<br />
ter followed it up so close, and told<br />
what advantages might be gained<br />
by settling there, and promised, if<br />
he should succeed, to turn all his<br />
trade into his master’s hand, and<br />
give him the refusal of whatever he<br />
might bring to market, and withal<br />
shewed him some draughts, which<br />
he had made with chalk, from the<br />
reports of the huntsmen, that Bull<br />
began to think of the matter in good<br />
earnest, and consulted his lawyer<br />
upon the subject, who, after due<br />
consideration of the premises, and<br />
stroking his band, advised him as<br />
follows. “Why yes, Mr. Bull, I<br />
don’t see why you ought not to<br />
look about you as well as your neigh-<br />
bours. There is <em>Lord Street</em>–he<br />
has a large manor adjoining to your<br />
forest, which, they say, yields him a<br />
fine rent, and, who knows, but this<br />
may bring you in as much, or more?<br />
–Then there is old <em>Lewis</em>, the cud-<br />
gel-player, and <em>Nic Frog</em>, the dra-<br />
per, who have, perhaps, (I say <em>per- *<br />
*haps</em>, Mr. Bull, because it may be<br />
a little doubtful on both sides, and<br />
in that case, you know, sir, it would<br />
not become gentlemen of our cloth,<br />
to speak positively) as good a claim<br />
as your honor to this land; but then<br />
it is a maxim, you know, that pos-<br />
session is eleven points of the law,<br />
and if you once get your foot upon<br />
it–they can not out you without a<br />
process, and your honor knows that<br />
your purse is as long as theirs, and<br />
you are as able to stand a suit with<br />
them as they are with you. I there-<br />
fore advise you to humour your man<br />
Walter, and give him a lease, and a<br />
pretty large one–you may find<br />
more advantages in it than you are<br />
aware of–but lease it, lease it at any<br />
rate.” Upon this he was ordered<br />
to make out a lease; and Walter be-<br />
ing thus invested with as good au-<br />
thority as could be obtained, filled<br />
his pockets with bread and cheese,<br />
took his gun, powder-flask, and shot<br />
of various kinds, with a parcel of<br />
fishing-lines and hooks, his survey-<br />
ing instruments, and a bag of corn<br />
on his shoulders, and off he trotted<br />
to his new paradise.</p>

<p>It was some time before he could<br />
fix upon a spot to his liking, and he<br />
at first met with some opposition<br />
from the bears and wolves, and was<br />
greatly exposed to the weather,<br />
before he could build him a hut;<br />
once or twice the savage animals had<br />
almost devoured him, but being<br />
made of good stuff, he stood his<br />
ground, cleared a little spot, put his<br />
seed into the earth, and lived as well<br />
as such adventurers can expect, poor-<br />
ly enough at first, but supported by<br />
the hope of better times. After a<br />
while he began to thrive, and his<br />
master Bull recommended a <em>wife</em> (<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>)<br />
to whom he married, and by whom<br />
he had a number of children. Hav-<br />
ing found a new sort of grain in the<br />
forest, and a certain plant of a nar-<br />
cotic quality, he cultivated both,<br />
and having procured a number of<br />
(<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>) <em>black-cattle</em>, he went on pretty<br />
gaily in the planting way, and<br />
brought his narcotic weed into great<br />
repute, by sending a present of a<br />
quantity of it to his old master, who<br />
grew excessively fond of it, and kept<br />
calling for more, till he got the<br />
whole trade of it into his own hands,<br />
and sold it out of his own ware-house<br />
to old Lewis, Nic Frog, and all the<br />
other tradesmen around him. In<br />
return he supplied Walter with<br />
cloths and stuffs for his family, and<br />
utensils for his husbandry; and as<br />
a reward for being the first, who had<br />
courage to make a settlement in his<br />
forest, and in token of his high es-<br />
teem of him as a customer, as well as<br />
for certain other reasons, he made<br />
it a practice every year, to present<br />
him with a waggon-load of ordure, <br />
(<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>) the sweepings of his back-yard,<br />
the scrapings of his dog-kennel, and<br />
contents of his own water closet.<br />
This was a mark of politeness which<br />
John valued himself much upon. “It<br />
may seem odd (said he one day to a<br />
friend) that I make such a kind of<br />
compliment as this to my good cus-<br />
tomer; but if you consider it a-<br />
right you will find it a piece of re-<br />
fined policy–for by this means I<br />
get rid of a deal of trash and rub-<br />
bish that is necessarily made in such<br />
a family as mine; I get a cursed<br />
stink removed from under my nose,<br />
and my good friend has the advan-<br />
tage of it upon his farm, to manure<br />
his grounds, and make them produce<br />
more plentifully that precious weed<br />
in which we all so much delight.”<br />
Walter was often seen, on the arri-<br />
val of Bull’s waggon, to clap his<br />
handkerchief to his nose; but as he<br />
knew his old master was an odd sort<br />
of a fellow, and it was his interest<br />
to keep in with him, he generally<br />
turned off the compliment with a<br />
laugh, saying, good naturedly e-<br />
nough, “Let him laugh that wins,”<br />
without explaining his meaning, tho’<br />
it might admit of a <em>double entendre</em>,<br />
–and calling some of his servants,<br />
he ordered them to shovel out the<br />
dung, and make his black cattle mix<br />
theirs with it–and when spread over<br />
the land, the air took out most of<br />
the scent, and the salts were of some<br />
advantage to the soil.</p>

<p>After Walter Pipe-weed had got<br />
his affairs into tolerable order, he<br />
was visited in his retirement by <br />
<em>Frederick Peterson</em> (<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>), another of<br />
Bull’s apprentices, who had taken<br />
a fancy to the same kind of life,<br />
from a disgust to some things that<br />
had happened in the family. He<br />
had not been long with Walter be-<br />
fore he found it would not do for<br />
him to remain there. Frederick<br />
was supposed to be a natural son of<br />
old <em>Lord Peter</em>, after whom he was<br />
nick-named. He had the same af-<br />
fected airs, and a tincture of the<br />
high flying notions of his reputed fa-<br />
ther. These made him rather dis-<br />
gustful to Walter, who had learned<br />
his manners of Mr. Bull’s mother,<br />
when she was in her sober senses,<br />
and between her and Lord Peter<br />
there had been a long variance.<br />
When Frederick perceived that his<br />
company was not desired, he had so<br />
much good sense as to leave Walter’s<br />
plantation, and paddling across a<br />
creek, seated himself on a point of<br />
land that ran out into the lake. Of<br />
this he obtained a lease of his old<br />
master, and went to work in the<br />
same manner as Walter had done,<br />
who, liking his company best at a<br />
distance, was willing to supply him<br />
with bread and meat till he could<br />
scramble for himself. Here he took<br />
to husbandry, raising corn and the<br />
narcotic weed, and buying up <em>black *<br />
*cattle</em>, and after a while turned his<br />
produce into his old master’s ware-<br />
house, and received from him the<br />
annual compliment of a waggon-<br />
load of dung, excepting that when<br />
there had not been so much as usual<br />
made, he and Walter were to share<br />
a load between them.</p>

<p>To ingratiate himself still farther<br />
with his old master, he accepted of<br />
a girl out of his family for a wife,<br />
(for John was always fond of his<br />
tenants marrying for fear of their<br />
doing worse) he took as little notice<br />
as possible of his reputed father, and<br />
dropping, or disowning his nick-<br />
name of Peterson, he assumed that of <br />
<em>Marygold</em>, which old Madam Bull<br />
understood as a compliment to one<br />
of her daughters.–He also made<br />
his court to the old lady by kneel-<br />
ing down and kissing the fringe of<br />
her embroidered petticoat, as was<br />
the fashion of that day. This cere-<br />
mony, tho’ a trifle in itself, helped<br />
much to recommend him to Mr.<br />
Bull, who was a very dutiful son,<br />
and took his mother’s advice in most<br />
parts of his business. In short, Fre-<br />
derick was too much of a politician<br />
to suppose that filial affection ought<br />
to stand in the way of a man’s inte-<br />
rest, and in this he judged as most<br />
other men would have done in the<br />
same circumstances.</p>

<p>The FORESTERS, <em>An</em> AMERICAN TALE, <em>being a Sequel to the History of</em>
JOHN BULL, <em>the Clothier.</em></p>

<p>[<em>Continued from Page 456.</em>]</p>

<p>ABOUT the time in which<br />
these first attempts were mak-<br />
ing, and the fame of them had<br />
raised much jealousy among some,<br />
and much expectation among others,<br />
there happened a sad quarrel in John<br />
Bull’s family. His mother, (<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>) poor<br />
Woman, had been seized with hyste-<br />
ric fits, which caused her at times<br />
to be delirious and full of all sorts<br />
of whims. She had taken it into<br />
her head that every one of the fa-<br />
mily must hold knife and fork and<br />
spoon exactly alike; that they must<br />
all wash their hands and face pre-<br />
cisely in the same manner; that<br />
they must sit, stand, walk, kneel,<br />
bow, spit, blow their noses, and<br />
perform every other animal function<br />
by the exact rule of <em>uniformity</em>,<br />
which she had drawn up with her<br />
own hand, and from which they<br />
were not allowed to vary one hair’s<br />
breadth. If any one of the family<br />
complained of a lame ancle or stiff<br />
knee, or had the crick in his neck,<br />
or happened to cut his finger, or<br />
was any other way so disabled as not<br />
to perform his duty to a tittle, she<br />
was so far from making the least al-<br />
lowance, that she would frown and<br />
scold and rave like a bedlamite; and<br />
John was such an obedient son to his<br />
mother, that he would lend her his<br />
hand to cut their ears, or his foot<br />
to kick their backsides, for not com-<br />
plying with her humours. This<br />
way of proceeding raised an uproar<br />
in the family; for though most of<br />
them complied, either through af-<br />
fection for the old lady, or through<br />
fear, or some other motive, yet<br />
others looked sour, and grumbled;<br />
some would openly find fault and<br />
attempt to remonstrate, but they<br />
were answered with a kick or a<br />
thump, or a cat-o’nine tails, or shut<br />
up in a dark garret ‘till they pro-<br />
mised a compliance. Such was the<br />
logic of the family in those days!<br />
Among the number of the disaf-<br />
fected, was PEREGRINE PICKLE, (<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup>) <br />
a pretty honest, clever sort of a fel-<br />
low about his business, but a great<br />
lover of sour crout, and of an hu-<br />
mour that would not bear con-<br />
tradiction. However, as he knew<br />
it would be fruitless to enter into<br />
a downright quarrel, and yet he<br />
could not live there in peace; he<br />
had so much prudence as to quit the<br />
house, which he did by getting out<br />
of the window in the night. Not<br />
liking to be out of employ, he went<br />
to the house of NIC. FROG, (<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup>) <br />
his master’s old friend and rival, told<br />
him the story of his sufferings, and<br />
got leave to employ himself in one<br />
of his garrets ‘till the storm should<br />
be over. After he had been here<br />
a while, he thought Nick’s family<br />
were as much too loose in their man-<br />
ners as Bull’s were too strict; and<br />
having heard a rumour of the Forest,<br />
to which Nick had some kind of<br />
claim, he packed up his little all,<br />
and hired one of Nick’s servants<br />
who had been there a hunting, to<br />
pilot him to that part of the Forest<br />
to which Nick laid claim. But<br />
Frog had laid an anchor to wind-<br />
ward of him; for as Pickle had<br />
said nothing to him about a lease,<br />
he supposed that when Peregrine<br />
had got into the Forest he would<br />
take a lease of his old master, Bull,<br />
which would strengthen his title,<br />
and weaken his own; he therefore<br />
bribed the pilot to shew Peregrine<br />
to a barren part of the Forest instead<br />
of that fertile place (<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup>) to which he<br />
had already sent his surveyors, and<br />
of which he was contriving to get<br />
possession. Accordingly the pilot<br />
having conducted Pickle to a sandy<br />
point which runs into the lake, (<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup>)<br />
it being the dusk of the evening, (<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup>) <br />
bade him good night, and walked<br />
off. Peregrine, who was fatigued<br />
with his march, laid down and went<br />
to sleep, but waking in the morning,<br />
saw himself alone in a very dreary<br />
situation, where he could get no-<br />
thing to live upon but clams, and a<br />
few acorns which the squirrels had<br />
left. In this piteous plight the poor<br />
fellow folded his arms, and walking<br />
along the sandy beach, fell into such<br />
a soliloquy as this. “So much for<br />
travelling! Abused by Bull, cheat-<br />
ed by Frog, what am I at last come<br />
to? Here I am alone, no creatures<br />
but bears, and wolves, and such<br />
vermin around me! Nothing in the<br />
shape of an human being that I<br />
know of, nearer than Pipeweed’s<br />
plantation, and with him I cannot<br />
agree, he is so devoted to old Dame<br />
Bull that he and I cannot live toge-<br />
ther any more than I could with the<br />
old woman. But, why should I<br />
despair? That is unmanly; there<br />
is at least a <em>possibility</em> of my living<br />
here, and if I am disappointed in<br />
my worldly prospects, it is but<br />
right, for I professed not to have<br />
any. My wish was to have my<br />
own way without disturbance or<br />
contradiction, and surely I can here<br />
enjoy my liberty. I have nobody<br />
here to curse me, or kick me, or<br />
cheat me. If I have only clams to<br />
eat, I can cook them my own way,<br />
and say as long a grace over them as<br />
I please. I can sit or stand, or kneel,<br />
or use any other posture at my de-<br />
votions, without any cross old wo-<br />
man to growl at me, or any hector-<br />
ing bully to cuff me for it. So that<br />
if I have lost in one way I have<br />
gained in another. I had better<br />
therefore reconcile myself to my si-<br />
tuation and make the best of a bad<br />
market. But company is good!<br />
Apropos! I will write to some of<br />
my fellow-prentices; I know they<br />
were as discontented as myself in<br />
old Bull’s family, though they did<br />
not care to speak their minds as<br />
plainly as I did. I’ll tell them how<br />
much happiness I enjoy here in my<br />
solitude. I’ll point out to them the<br />
charms of liberty, and coax them<br />
to follow me into the wilderness;<br />
and by and by, when we get all to-<br />
gether, we shall make a brave hand<br />
of it.” Full of this resolution, he<br />
sat down on a windfallen tree, and<br />
pulling out his inkhorn and paper,<br />
wrote a letter to JOHN CODLINE,<br />
HUMPHRY PLOUGHSHARE, and<br />
ROGER CARRIER, three of his fel-<br />
low-apprentices, informing them of<br />
the extreme happiness he enjoyed in<br />
having liberty to eat his scanty meals<br />
in his own way, and to lay his swell-<br />
ed ancles and stiff knee in whatever<br />
posture was most easy to him, con-<br />
juring them by their former friend-<br />
ship, to come to join them in car-<br />
rying on the good work so happily<br />
begun, &amp;c. &amp;c. As soon as he had<br />
finished the letter, (which had deep-<br />
ly engaged his attention) a hunts-<br />
man happened to come along in<br />
quest of game. This was a lucky<br />
circumstance indeed, for Peregrine<br />
had not once thought of a convey-<br />
ance for his letter; it proved also<br />
favourable to him in another view,<br />
for the huntsman taking pity on his<br />
forlorn situation, spared him some<br />
powder and shot and a few biscuit<br />
which he happened to have in his<br />
pocket; so taking charge of the<br />
letter, he delivered it as it was<br />
directed.</p>

<p>This letter arrived in good sea-<br />
son, for Old Madam had grown<br />
much worse since Pickle had left<br />
the family : her vapours had in-<br />
creased, and her longings and aver-<br />
sions were much stronger. She had<br />
a strange lurch for embroidered pet-<br />
ticoats and high waving plumes;<br />
her Christmas pies must have double<br />
the quantity of spice that was us-<br />
ual; the servants must make three<br />
bows where they formerly made but<br />
one, and they must never come into<br />
her presence without having curled<br />
and powdered their hair in the pink<br />
of the mode, for she had an aversion<br />
to every thing plain, and an high<br />
relish for every thing gaudy. Be-<br />
sides, she had retained an high met-<br />
tled chaplain (<sup id="fnref:12"><a href="#fn:12" class="footnote">12</a></sup>) who was constant-<br />
ly at her elbow, and said prayers<br />
night and morning in a brocaded<br />
vest with a gilded mitre on his<br />
head; and he exacted so many bows<br />
and scrapes of every one in the fa-<br />
mily, that it would have puzzled a<br />
French dancing master to have kept<br />
pace with him. Nor would he per-<br />
form the service at all unless a ver-<br />
ger stood by him all the while with<br />
a yard-wand in his hand; and if<br />
any servant or apprentice missed one<br />
bow or scrape, or made it at the<br />
wrong time, or dared to look off<br />
his book, or said Amen in the wrong<br />
place, rap went the stick over his<br />
head and ears or nuckles. It was in<br />
vain to appeal from the chaplain or<br />
the old Dame to their master, for<br />
he was so obedient a son that he<br />
suffered them to govern him as they<br />
pleased; nay, though broad hints<br />
were given that the chaplain was an<br />
emissary of lord Peter (<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup>) and was<br />
taking advantage of the old lady’s<br />
hysterics to bring the whole family<br />
into his interest, John gave no heed<br />
to any of these insinuations.<br />
As soon as the letter of Pere-<br />
grine Pickle arrived, the apprenti-<br />
ces, to whom it was directed, held a<br />
consultation what they should do.<br />
They were heartily tired of the con-<br />
duct of the chaplain; they lament-<br />
ed the old lady’s ill health, and<br />
wished for a cure; but there was at<br />
present no hope of it, and there-<br />
fore concluded that it was best to<br />
follow Pickle’s advice, and retire<br />
with him into the Forest. Though<br />
they were infected with the spirit of<br />
adventure, yet they were a set of<br />
wary fellows, and knew they could<br />
not with safety venture thither un-<br />
less they had a lease of the land.<br />
Happily, however, for them, Bull<br />
had a little while before that put the<br />
affairs of the Forest into the hands<br />
of a gentleman of the law, (<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>) with<br />
orders to see that the matter was<br />
properly managed so as to yield him<br />
some certain profit. To this sage<br />
they applied, and for the proper<br />
fees, which they clubbed for be-<br />
tween them, they obtained a lease,<br />
under hand and seal; wherein, for<br />
“sundry causes him thereunto mov-<br />
ing, the said Bull did grant and<br />
convey unto John Codline and his<br />
associates, so many acres of his Fo-<br />
rest, bounded so and so, and which<br />
they were to have, hold, and enjoy<br />
for ever and ever and the day after,<br />
yielding and paying so and so, and<br />
so forth.” When this grand point<br />
was gained by the assistance of the<br />
lawyer and <em>his clerks</em>, who knew<br />
how to manage business: they sold<br />
all their superfluities to the pawn-<br />
brokers, and got together what<br />
things they supposed they should<br />
want, and leaving behind them a<br />
note on the compter, (<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup>) to tell their<br />
master where they were bound and<br />
what were their designs : they set<br />
off all together and got safe into a<br />
part of the Forest adjoining to<br />
Pickle, who hearing of their arrival,<br />
took his oaken staff in his hand and<br />
hobbled along as fast as his lame<br />
legs could carry him to see them, and<br />
a joyful meeting indeed they had.<br />
Having laid their heads together, it<br />
was agreed that Codline should send<br />
for a girl whom he had courted, (<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup>)<br />
and marry her, and that he should<br />
be considered as the lord of the<br />
manor, that Pickle should have a<br />
lease of that part which he had<br />
pitched upon, and that Plough-<br />
share and Carrier should for the pre-<br />
sent be considered as members of<br />
Codline’s family. John had taken<br />
a great fancy to fishing, and thought<br />
he could wholly or chiefly subsist by<br />
it; but Humphry had a mind for a<br />
farm; so after a while they parted<br />
in friendship. Humphry, with a<br />
pack on his back and a spade in his<br />
hand, travelled across the Forest ‘till<br />
he found a wide meadow with a<br />
large brook (<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup>) running through it,<br />
which he supposed to be within<br />
John’s grant, and intended still to<br />
consider himself as a distant member<br />
of the family. But as it fell out<br />
otherwise, he was obliged to get a<br />
new lease, to which Mr. Frog made<br />
some objections, but they were over-<br />
ruled; and soon after another old<br />
fellow-servant, TOBIAS WHEATER,<br />
(<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup>) came and sat down by him.<br />
They being so much alike in their<br />
views and dispositions, agreed to<br />
live together as intimates, though<br />
in two families, which they did ‘till<br />
Wheater’s death, when Plough-<br />
share became his sole heir, and the<br />
estate has ever since been his. This<br />
Humphry was always a very indus-<br />
trious, frugal, saving husband; and<br />
his wife, though a formal strait-<br />
laced sort of a body, yet always<br />
minded her spinning and knitting,<br />
and took excellent care of her<br />
dairy. She always clothed her<br />
children in homespun garments,<br />
and scarcely ever spent a farthing<br />
for outlandish trinkets. The fa-<br />
mily and all its concerns were<br />
under very exact regulations: not<br />
one of them was suffered to peep out<br />
of doors after the sun was set. It<br />
was never allowed to brew on Sa-<br />
turday, lest the beer should break<br />
the Fourth Commandment by work-<br />
ing on Sunday: and once it is said<br />
the stallion was impounded a<br />
whole week for having held <em>crim. *<br />
*con.</em> with the mare while the Old<br />
Gentleman was at his devotions.<br />
Bating these peculiarities, (and eve-<br />
ry body has some) Humphry was a<br />
very good sort of man, a kind neigh-<br />
bor, very thriving, and made a<br />
respectable figure, though he lived<br />
a retired life and did not much fol-<br />
low the fashions, yet he raised a<br />
good estate, and brought up a large<br />
family, who knew how to get their<br />
living wherever they could find land.</p>

<p>The FORESTERS.</p>

<p><em>An</em> AMERICAN TALE, <em>being a Sequel to the History of</em> JOHN BULL, <em>the
Clothier.</em></p>

<p>[<em>Continued from Page 517.</em>]</p>

<p>AFTER Ploughshare’s depar-<br />
ture, John Codline with his<br />
family kept on their fishing and<br />
planting, and sometimes went a<br />
hunting, so that they made out to<br />
get a tolerable subsistence. John’s<br />
family grew, and he settled his sons<br />
as fast as they became of age, to live<br />
by themselves; and when any of<br />
his old acquaintance came to see<br />
him, he bade them welcome, and<br />
was their very good friend, <em>as long *<br />
*as they continued to be of his mind</em> <br />
and no longer; for he was a very<br />
pragmatical sort of a fellow, and<br />
loved to have his own way in every<br />
thing. This was the cause of a<br />
quarrel between him and <em>Roger *<br />
*Carrier</em> (<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup>), for it happened that<br />
Roger had taken a fancy to dip his<br />
head into (<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup>) water, as the most<br />
effectual way of washing his face,<br />
and thought it could not be made so<br />
clean in any other way. John, who<br />
used the common way of taking<br />
water in his hand, to wash his face,<br />
was displeased with Roger’s innova-<br />
tion, and remonstrated against it.<br />
The remonstrance had no other ef-<br />
fect, than to fix Roger’s opinion<br />
more firmly, and as a farther im-<br />
provement on his new plan, he pre-<br />
tended that no person ought to have<br />
his face washed till he was capable<br />
of doing it himself, without any as-<br />
sistance from his parents. John was<br />
out of patience with this addition,<br />
and plumply told him, that if he<br />
did not reform his principles and<br />
practice, he would fine him, or flog<br />
him, or kick him out of doors. These<br />
threats put Roger on inventing<br />
other odd and whimsical opinions.<br />
He took offence at the letter X, and<br />
would have had it expunged from<br />
the alphabet. (<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup>) He would not<br />
do his duty at a military muster,<br />
because there was an X in the co-<br />
lours. After a while he began to<br />
scruple the lawfulness of bearing<br />
arms, and killing wild beasts. But,<br />
poor fellow! the worst of all was,<br />
that being seized with a shaking<br />
palsy (<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup>), which affected every limb<br />
and joint of him; his speech was so<br />
altered that he was unable to pro-<br />
nounce certain letters and syllables<br />
as he had been used to do. These<br />
oddities and defects rendered him<br />
more and more disagreeable to his<br />
old friend, who, however, kept his<br />
temper as well as he could, till one<br />
day, as John was saying a long grace<br />
over his meat, Roger kept his hat<br />
on the whole time. As soon as the<br />
ceremony was over, John took up a<br />
case knife from the table, and gave<br />
Roger a blow on the ear with the<br />
broad side of it, then with a rising<br />
stroke turned off his hat. Roger said<br />
nothing, but taking up his hat put<br />
it on again; at which John broke<br />
out into such a passionate speech as<br />
this “You impudent scoundrel! is<br />
it come to this! Have I not borne<br />
with your whims and fidgets these<br />
many years, and yet they grow up-<br />
on you? Have I not talked with<br />
you time after time, and proved to<br />
you as plain as the nose in your face<br />
that your notions are wrong? Have<br />
I not ordered you to leave them off,<br />
and warned you of the consequence,<br />
and yet you have gone on from bad<br />
to worse. You began with dipping<br />
your head into water, and would<br />
have all the family do the same, pre-<br />
tending there was no other way of<br />
washing the face. You would have<br />
had the children go dirty all their<br />
days, under pretence that they were<br />
not able to wash their own faces, and<br />
so they must have looked like the pigs<br />
till they were grown up. Then you<br />
would talk your own balderdash<br />
linguo, [sic] <em>thee and thou, and nan</em>–<br />
<em>forsooth</em>–and now you must keep<br />
your hat on when I am at my devo-<br />
tions, and I suppose would be glad<br />
to have the whole family do the<br />
same! There is no bearing with<br />
you any longer–so now–hear me,<br />
I give you fair warning, if you don’t<br />
mend your manners, and retract your<br />
errors, and promise reformation, I’ll<br />
kick you out of the house. I’d<br />
have no such refractory fellows here,<br />
I came into this forest for <em>reforma- *<br />
*tion</em>, and reformation I <em>will</em> have.”<br />
“Friend John (said Roger) dost<br />
not thou remember when thou and<br />
I lived together in friend Bull’s fa-<br />
mily, how hard thou didst think it<br />
to be compelled to look on thy book<br />
all the time that the hooded chap-<br />
lain was reading the prayers, and<br />
how many knocks and thumps thou<br />
and I had for offering to use our li-<br />
berty, which we thought we had a<br />
right to? Didst thou not come hi-<br />
therunto for the sake of enjoying<br />
thy liberty, and did not I come to<br />
enjoy mine? Wherefore then dost<br />
thou assume to deprive me of the<br />
right which thou claimest for thy-<br />
self?”</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me (answered John)<br />
of right and of liberty–you have<br />
as much liberty as any man ought<br />
to have. You have liberty to do<br />
right, and no man ought to have<br />
liberty to do wrong.”</p>

<p>“Who is to be judge (replied<br />
Roger) what is right or what is<br />
wrong? Ought not I to judge for<br />
myself? or thinkest thou it is thy<br />
place to judge for me?”</p>

<p>“Who is to be judge (said John)<br />
why <em>the book</em> is to be judge–and I<br />
have proved by the book over and<br />
over again that you are wrong, and<br />
therefore you are wrong, and you<br />
have no liberty to do any thing but<br />
what is right.”</p>

<p>“But friend John (said Roger)<br />
who is to judge whether thou hast<br />
proved my opinions or conduct to<br />
be wrong–thou or I? [sic]<br />
“Come, come, (said John) not so<br />
close neither–none of your idle dis-<br />
tinctions, I <em>say</em> you are in the wrong,<br />
I have <em>proved</em> it, and <em>you know</em> it,<br />
you have sinned against <em>your own *<br />
*conscience</em>, and therefore you deserve<br />
to be cut off as an incorrigible he-<br />
retic.”</p>

<p>“How dost thou know (said<br />
Roger) that I have sinned against<br />
my own conscience? Canst thou<br />
search the heart?”</p>

<p>At this John was so enraged that<br />
he gave him a smart kick on the<br />
posteriors, and bade him be gone out<br />
of his house, and off his lands, and<br />
called after him to tell him, that if<br />
ever he should catch him there again<br />
he would knock his brains out. Ro-<br />
ger having experienced that the lo-<br />
gic of the foot, applied to the breech<br />
is the most powerful of arguments,<br />
walked off; but had so much of hu-<br />
man nature left in him, as to turn up<br />
the folds of his coat, and expose the<br />
insulted part to view, which action,<br />
however expressive, has always been<br />
deemed no swearing, nor breach of<br />
the peace.–Thus they parted, and<br />
Roger having travelled as far as he<br />
supposed to be out of the limits of<br />
John’s lease, laid himself down by<br />
the side of a clear rivulet, which<br />
flowed down a hill; here he com-<br />
posed himself to sleep, and on his<br />
awaking found several bears about<br />
him, but none offered him any in-<br />
sult. Upon which he said, and mi-<br />
nuted it down in his pocket book,<br />
“Surely the beasts of the wilder-<br />
ness are in friendship with me, and<br />
this is designed by <em>Providence</em> (<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup>) as<br />
my resting place; here, therefore,<br />
will I pitch my tabernacle, and here<br />
shall I dwell more in peace, though<br />
surrounded by bears and wolves, than<br />
when in the midst of those whom I<br />
counted my brethren.”</p>

<p>On this spot he built an hut, and<br />
having taken possession, made a visit<br />
to his old master Bull, who gave<br />
him a lease of the place, with an<br />
island or two in an adjoining cove of<br />
the great lake, and recommended<br />
to him a wife, by whom he had a<br />
few children; but his plantation was<br />
chiefly increased by the flocking of<br />
strangers to him; for he was a ve-<br />
ry hospitable man, and made it a<br />
rule in his family not to refuse any<br />
who should come, whether lame or<br />
blind, short or tall, whether they<br />
had two eyes or one, whether they s<br />
quinted or stammered, or limped, or<br />
had any other natural defect or im-<br />
pediment; it was another rule that<br />
every one should bear with the in-<br />
firmities of his neighbours, and help<br />
one another as they were able. I<br />
remember once as I was passing<br />
through Roger’s plantation I saw<br />
one man carrying another on his<br />
shoulders, which, at first, I thought<br />
a very odd sight; upon coming up<br />
to them, I perceived that the lower<br />
one was blind, and the upper one<br />
was lame, so as they had but one<br />
pair of eyes, and one pair of legs<br />
between them; the lame man avail-<br />
ed himself of the blind man’s legs,<br />
and he of the other’s eyes, and both<br />
went along very well together. I<br />
remember also, that as I passed along,<br />
the fences were in some places made<br />
of very crooked, knotty rails; but<br />
the crooks and knots were made to<br />
say [sic] into each other so cleverly, that<br />
the fences were as tight as if they<br />
had been made of stuff sawed ever so<br />
even; a circumstance which con-<br />
vinced me that very crooked things<br />
might be put together, to advan-<br />
tage, if proper pains were taken<br />
about it. This, however, was some<br />
time ago.–i have sine heard that<br />
the old crooks and knots and got<br />
out of order, and that they have not<br />
the art of making new ones say into<br />
one another so well as formerly.<br />
Whenever this happens it affords a<br />
kind of burlesque on the art of fence-<br />
making, but alas! how can it be<br />
otherwise when not but the lame<br />
and the blind are employed in the work?<br />
When John Codline had settled<br />
the controversy with Roger by kick-<br />
ing him out of doors, he began to<br />
look about him to see what his neigh-<br />
bours were doing. Having found a<br />
young fellow on his north-eastern<br />
limits, who had come thither with-<br />
out his knowledge or permission;<br />
he took it into his head to survey<br />
the extent of his grounds. The<br />
words of his lease were rather am-<br />
biguous, and by virtue thereof he<br />
thought it convenient to extend his<br />
claims over the lands on which <em>Ro- *<br />
*bert Lumber</em> (for that was the name<br />
of the young fellow) had settled.<br />
([^24]) It seems that Bob had been sent<br />
by some of John Bull’s family to<br />
erect a fishing stage on the borders<br />
of the Lake, and the lawyer who<br />
had the care of the forest not being<br />
acquainted so much as he ought to<br />
have been with the situation of the<br />
lands, or having no knowledge of the<br />
art of surveying, had made out a<br />
lease which lapped over Codline’s; so<br />
that each of them had a claim upon<br />
it. In some circumstances this might<br />
have been deemed unfortunate, but<br />
as it happened it proved lucky for<br />
poor Bob–his employers had left<br />
him in the lurch, and he would have<br />
starved to death if John had not<br />
taken him under his wing and sent<br />
him provisions to keep him alive.<br />
He also lent him a hand to clear up<br />
the bushes, and furnished him with<br />
materials to build a saw-mill. This<br />
set Bob on his own legs, and he<br />
proved a sturdy faithful fellow. He<br />
was of great service to John in kill-<br />
ing bears and wolves that infested<br />
his plantation; and when he himself<br />
was in danger, John lent him pow-<br />
der, shot, and flints, and sent hands<br />
to help him, and in so doing he serv-<br />
ed himself as well as his neighbour,<br />
which was no breach of morality.<br />
Thus they lived pretty peaceably to-<br />
gether, till after a while Bob’s old<br />
owners found the land was grown<br />
good for something, and then (with-<br />
out paying John for his assistance<br />
in making it so) appealed to Mr.<br />
Bull, and got it away, and took a<br />
large slice of John’s land into the<br />
bargain. ([^25]) This was a matter<br />
which stuck in John’s throat a great<br />
while, and if I am rightly informed<br />
he has hardly swallowed it yet.<br />
He did not think himself fairly dealt<br />
by though he had all Peregrine<br />
Pickle’s land put into a new lease<br />
which Bull gave him. To be short,<br />
John Codline and John Bull never<br />
heartily loved one another; they<br />
were in their temper and disposition<br />
too much alike; each was eternally<br />
jealous of the other: Business was,<br />
indeed, carried on pretty well be-<br />
tween them for many years, and had<br />
Mr Bull hearkened to the advice of<br />
his best friends, I suppose there<br />
would never have been any open<br />
quarrel between them.</p>

<p>[4. September 1787]</p>

<p>The FORESTERS,\
<em>An</em> AMERICAN TALE, <em>being a Sequel to the History of</em> JOHN BULL, <em>the
Clothier.</em></p>

<p>[<em>Continued from Page</em> 568.]</p>

<p>BETWEEN the lands occupied<br />
by Frederick Marygold, and<br />
those on which Humpry Plough-<br />
share had made his settlement, was<br />
a large tract of waste, where none<br />
of Mr. Bull’s family had ever been;<br />
but the report of the plantations<br />
which one and another of them had<br />
made, drew the attention of Bull’s<br />
neighbours. Among these, <em>Nicolas *<br />
*Frog</em> ([^26]) was not an idle spectator.<br />
He was as sly a fellow as you will<br />
meet with in a summer’s day, always<br />
attentive to his interest, and never<br />
let slip an opportunity to promote<br />
it. Observing that Mr. Bull was<br />
rather careless of the Forest, and trust-<br />
ed his lawyers and servants with the<br />
management of it, and knowing<br />
there was a large slice of it unoccu-<br />
pied, he clandestinely sent out some<br />
surveyors in the disguise of hunters,<br />
to make a description of the coun-<br />
try, and report to him at their re-<br />
turn. Another good neighbor<br />
GUSTAVUS, the ironmonger ([^27])<br />
was gaping after it, and gave out word<br />
among his journeymen, that if any<br />
of them would adventure thither<br />
and set up their trade, he would up-<br />
hold them in their pretensions, and<br />
lend them any assistance in his pow-<br />
er. Accordingly one of them, by the<br />
name of <em>Casimir</em>, ventured to make<br />
a beginning on the shore of a navi-<br />
gable creek; ([^28]) but did not care<br />
to penetrate far into the country,<br />
on account of the wolves and bears,<br />
which were very numerous thereabouts.<br />
As soon as Frog heard of this he<br />
picked a quarrel with Gustavus, and<br />
insisted that the land was his by<br />
possession, because he had already<br />
sent surveyors thither. It happened<br />
however, that the place which Frog’s<br />
people had pitched upon was at the<br />
mouth of another creek, ([^29]) at a<br />
considerable distance; where they<br />
had built a hut, on a point of land,<br />
and farther up the creek they had<br />
erected a kind of lodge or hunting-<br />
house, ([^30]) for the convenience of<br />
collecting game. On this planta-<br />
tion Frog had placed PETER STI-<br />
VER, a one-legged fellow, as his<br />
overseer. As soon as Peter heard<br />
of the quarrel between his master<br />
and Gustavus, he thought the quick-<br />
est way of ending it was the best;<br />
and therefore, without waiting for<br />
orders or ceremony, he went and<br />
commanded Casimir off the ground;<br />
and with one of his crutches beat<br />
his house to pieces about his ears.<br />
The poor fellow stared at this rough<br />
treatment; but was glad to escape<br />
with whole bones, and humbly re-<br />
quested leave to remain there with<br />
his tools, promising to follow his<br />
business quietly, and become an ob-<br />
edient servant to Mr. Frog; upon<br />
these conditions he was permitted<br />
to remain, and the whole tract was<br />
reputed Frog’s property.</p>

<p>While these things were doing<br />
John Bull was confined to his house<br />
with a violent fever and delirium ([^31]),<br />
under which he laboured for a long<br />
time, and his imagination was the<br />
seat of every wild freak and strange<br />
vagary. One while he fancied<br />
himself an absolute monarch, then,<br />
a presbyterian clergyman, then a<br />
general of horse, then a lord-pro-<br />
tector; his noddle was filled with a<br />
jumble of polemic divinity, political<br />
disputes, and military arrangements,<br />
and it was not till after much blood-<br />
letting, blistering, vomiting and<br />
purging, that he began to mend.<br />
Under this severe, but wholesome<br />
regimen, he at length grew cool and<br />
came to himself, but found on his<br />
recovery that his affairs had gone<br />
behind-hand during his sickness.<br />
Beside the loss of business, he had<br />
physicians and apothecaries bills to<br />
pay, and those who had attended<br />
upon him as nurses, watchers, por-<br />
ters, &amp;c. all expected wages or dou-<br />
ceurs, and were continually haunt-<br />
ing him with, How does your honour<br />
do? I am glad to see your honour so<br />
well as to be abroad. Some one or<br />
more were continually putting<br />
themselves in his way, and if they<br />
did not directly <em>dun</em> him for pay-<br />
ment, their looks were so signify-<br />
cant that a man of less penetration<br />
could easily have guessed what was<br />
their meaning.</p>

<p>Bull was somewhat perplexed<br />
how to answer all their demands<br />
and expectations. He was too far<br />
behind-hand to be able to satisfy<br />
them, and withal too generous to<br />
let them remain unpaid. At length<br />
he hit on this expedient: “These<br />
fellows (said he to himself) have<br />
served me well, and may be of use<br />
to me again. There is yet a con-<br />
siderable part of my forest unoccu-<br />
pied. I’ll offer to lease them tracts<br />
of land which <em>cost me nothing</em>, and<br />
if they will accept them at a low<br />
rent, they may prove useful ser-<br />
vants, and I shall be a gainer as well<br />
as they.” Having come to this<br />
resolution, he began to enquire<br />
into the affairs of his forest, and found<br />
that his neighbours had intruded<br />
upon his claim. LEWIS had taken<br />
possession at one end ([^32]); Lord<br />
STRUT at the ([^33]) other; and NIC<br />
FROG in the middle ([^34]), and his<br />
own tenants had been quarrelling<br />
with their new neighbours, as well<br />
as among themselves. “Hey day,<br />
(says John) this will never do; I<br />
must keep a good look out upon<br />
these dogs, or they will get the ad-<br />
vantage of me.” Away he goes to<br />
Frog, and begun to complain of the<br />
ill treatment which he had received.<br />
Frog who had no mind either to<br />
quarrel, or to cry peccavi, like a<br />
sly, evasive whore-son as he was,<br />
shrugged up his shoulders, disowned<br />
what his servants had done, and said,<br />
he supposed they only meant to kill<br />
game, and did not intend to hold<br />
possession. Bull was not to be put<br />
off so; his blood was up and he de-<br />
termined to treat Frog’s servants<br />
as they had treated Casimir. So, cal-<br />
ling a trusty old stud out of his<br />
compting house, “Here Bob ([^35])<br />
(said he) take one of my servants<br />
with a couple of blood hounds, and<br />
go to that part of the forest where<br />
Peter Stiver has encroached, give<br />
him fair warning; tell him the land<br />
is mine, and I will have it; if he<br />
gives up at once, treat him well and<br />
tell him I’ll give him leave to re-<br />
main there; but if he offers to make<br />
any resistance, or hesitates about an<br />
answer, set your dogs at him and<br />
drive him off; kill his cattle and set<br />
his house on fire; never fear, I’ll<br />
bear you out in it.” Away goes<br />
Bob and delivered his message; Pe-<br />
ter at first thought it a matter of<br />
amusement, and begun to divert<br />
himself with it; but as soon as the<br />
dogs opened upon him he found his<br />
mistake, and rather than run the<br />
risk of being driven off, he quietly<br />
submitted to the conditions proposed.<br />
“Hang it (said he to himself)<br />
what care I who is my landlord?<br />
Gain is my object, I have already<br />
been at great expense, and have a<br />
prospect of getting an estate, to re-<br />
move will ruin me, I’ll therefore<br />
stay here, and make money under<br />
Bull, or Frog, or any other master<br />
that will let me stay.”</p>

<p>In a subsequent quarrel which<br />
happened between Bull and Frog–<br />
the latter seized upon this planta-<br />
tion again, and Peter recognized<br />
his old master; but upon a com-<br />
promise it was given up to Bull in<br />
exchange for a tract of swamp ([^36])<br />
which lay far to the southward.<br />
Peter continued on the ground<br />
through all these changes, and follow-<br />
ed his business with great diligence,<br />
collecting game and pelts, and ven-<br />
ding them sometimes to Mr. Bull,<br />
and sometimes to Mr. Frog. How-<br />
ever, Bull thought it best that, in<br />
token of subjection, Stiver should<br />
change his name; to which he con-<br />
sented, and partly to please his new<br />
master, and partly to retain the re-<br />
membrance of his old one, he assum-<br />
ed the name of BULL FROG.</p>

<p>The whole tract which was thus<br />
gotten from Frog, was thought too<br />
large for one plantation, and there-<br />
fore Mr. Bull, in pursuance of the<br />
plan which he had formed appro-<br />
priated the rents of the plantation,<br />
on which Bull Frog was seated to<br />
his brother, and the other part<br />
which had been taken from Casimir<br />
was leafed to two of his servants,<br />
CART-RUT and BARE-CLAY, and<br />
sometime after another tract was<br />
set off to WILLIAM BROADBRIM,<br />
whose father had been an assiduous<br />
rat-catcher in Mr. Bull’s family;<br />
but more of this hereafter.</p>

<p><em>Cart-rut</em> and <em>Bare-clay</em> agreed<br />
to divide their land into two farms,<br />
which they called the east and west<br />
farms; ([^37]) but when they came to<br />
run the division line, their compasses<br />
differed so much that they could<br />
not fix the boundary. This was<br />
one cause of dissention. Another<br />
was the different humors and dispo-<br />
sitions of their families. Those on<br />
the East farm were brought up un-<br />
der Mr. Bull’s sister PEG ([^38]); and<br />
as it is well known that she and her<br />
brother had long been at variance,<br />
so their domestics had got tinctured<br />
with the notions and prejudices of<br />
their respective families. The fa-<br />
mily on the West farm was made up<br />
of persons who were subject to the<br />
epidemic ague or shaking palsy ([^39]);<br />
with some stragglers from Bull-<br />
frog’s and Casimir’s families. From<br />
this diversity of constitutions and<br />
humours arose bickerings and quar-<br />
rels, a disinclination to work<br />
and submit to family government.<br />
These disorders continued a long<br />
while, and business went on very<br />
slowly, till at length the heads of<br />
both families agreed to give up their<br />
separate leases, and take a new one<br />
of the whole, and let Mr. Bull appoint<br />
an overseer. By these means peace<br />
was restored, and the new overseer,<br />
who was supposed to be a descen-<br />
dant of JULIUS CæSAR, gave the<br />
name of his ancestor to the farm,<br />
which has ever since been called Cæ-<br />
SAREA.</p>

<p>There was another large portion<br />
of the forest, which lay southward<br />
of Walter Pipe-weed’s plantation,<br />
and which no person had yet taken<br />
up, though some had made attempts<br />
and had been driven off by the num-<br />
berless musquitoes and sand-flies,<br />
which abounded in those places.<br />
Mr. Bull was still desirous to re-<br />
ward his friends in the <em>cheapest man- *<br />
*ner</em>, and at the same time to keep<br />
his neighbors from encroaching<br />
upon him, and secure the possession<br />
of the forest to himself. In pursu-<br />
ance of his plan, and to make short<br />
work of it at once, he leased the<br />
whole of this southern extremity to<br />
CHARLES INDIGO, ([^40]) who was<br />
expressly ordered to take under his<br />
care and into his family all persons<br />
who had attended Mr. Bull, in his<br />
late sickness, in quality of nurses,<br />
druggists, apothecaries, laundresses,<br />
upholsters, porters, watchers, &amp;c.<br />
&amp;c. By this order Charles found<br />
himself at once surrounded by a large<br />
body of retainers of various ranks<br />
and qualities, and being a speculator<br />
himself, he employed a speculative<br />
man, Mr. <em>Padlock</em> (who had written<br />
a large treatise upon <em>Ideas</em>) to draw<br />
up some rules, for the management<br />
of such a family, intending when he<br />
should build an house, to paste it up<br />
in the parlour, as a directory to his<br />
wife. Accordingly Mr. Padlock<br />
went to work, and with an exquisite<br />
mixture of political and metaphysical<br />
knowledge, distinguished between<br />
the hall, the parlour, the dressing<br />
room, the gallery, the music-room,<br />
the bed-chambers, the chapel, the<br />
kitchen, the water-closet, &amp;c. shew-<br />
ing what was to be done in each,<br />
and the proper subordination of one<br />
to the other, all which would have<br />
been of excellent service in a palace,<br />
and among people who had got to a<br />
high degree of refinement, but was<br />
ill suited to the circumstances of new<br />
adventurers in a forest. They rather<br />
needed to be instructed in the me-<br />
thod of felling trees, draining<br />
swamps, digging clams, guarding<br />
against musquitoes, killing wolves<br />
and bears, and erecting huts to keep<br />
off the weather. To these neces-<br />
sary affairs they were obliged to at-<br />
tend, and Mr. Padlock’s fine-spun<br />
rules were laid by and little thought of.<br />
Charles had pitched upon a sandy<br />
point, between two brooks for his<br />
mansion-house, and had made a small<br />
beginning when his repose was dis-<br />
turbed by one AUGUSTINE, ([^41]) a<br />
lubberly fellow, who had taken a<br />
lease of Lord STRUT, and lived<br />
farther southward. This Strut was<br />
the largest landholder in the coun-<br />
try, and was never satisfied with ad-<br />
ding field to field. He had already<br />
got much more than he could ma-<br />
nage, and had greatly impoverished<br />
his home-stead by attending to his<br />
extra-territories. His tenants were<br />
infected with the same land-fever,<br />
and wished to have no neighbors<br />
within sight or call. From this en-<br />
vious disposition Augustine collect-<br />
ed a rabble of lousy fellows, and<br />
was coming to dispossess Charles,<br />
thinking him too weak to make a<br />
defence; but Charles was a lad of<br />
too much <em>spunk</em> to be brow-beaten<br />
by such fellows. He armed all his<br />
people with some weapon or other,<br />
and advanced till he came within<br />
sight of the place where Augustine<br />
was, who on seeing him, took wit<br />
in his anger and went back, without<br />
attempting any mischief.</p>

<p>Another difficulty which Charles<br />
expected to encounter was from the<br />
wild beasts; but luckily for him,<br />
these creatures got into a quarrel<br />
among themselves, and fought with<br />
each other till they had thinned<br />
their numbers considerably, so that<br />
Charles and his companions could<br />
venture into the woods, where they<br />
caught some few and tamed them,<br />
as was the usual practice among all<br />
Mr. Bull’s tenants at that day. Of this<br />
practice a more particular account<br />
shall be given, by way of digression.</p>

<p>[5. October 1787]</p>

<p>The FORESTERS,\</p>

<p><em>An</em> AMERICAN TALE, <em>being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the
Clothier.</em></p>

<p>[<em>Continued from page 622.</em>]</p>

<p>It must have been remarked by<br />
every person who has read the<br />
life and character of Mr. John Bull,<br />
that he was very whimsical, and as<br />
positive as he was whimsical. Among<br />
other advantages which he expect-<br />
ed from the settlement of his Forest,<br />
one was, that the wild animals<br />
whom nature had made ferocious and<br />
untractable in the highest degree,<br />
would be rendered tame and ser-<br />
viceable, by receiving instruction and<br />
education from the nurturing hand<br />
of humanity. He had conceived<br />
a notion that every creature has certain la-<br />
tent principles and qualities which<br />
form a foundation for improve-<br />
ment; and he thought it a great piece<br />
of injustice that these qualities should<br />
be suffered to remain uncultivated; he<br />
had a mind that experiments should be<br />
attempted to discover how far this<br />
kind of cultivation was practicable,<br />
and what use could be made of the<br />
animal powers under the direction<br />
and control of rational government.<br />
Full of this idea, he came to a reso-<br />
lation [sic], that it should be the duty of<br />
every one of his tenants to catch<br />
wild beasts of various sorts, and dis-<br />
cipline them so as to find out their<br />
several properties and capacities, and<br />
use them accordingly; and this kind<br />
of service was mentioned in their re-<br />
spective leases as one condition of<br />
the grants.</p>

<p>Some of the tenants, particularly<br />
Peregrine Pickle, John Codline, and<br />
Humphry Ploughshare, entered zea-<br />
lously into the measure from princi-<br />
ple. They had, during Mr. Bull’s<br />
sickness and delirium, (before spoken<br />
of) formed an association for their<br />
mutual safety. ([^42]) The object of<br />
their union was two fold: first,<br />
to endeavour by all fair means to<br />
tame and discipline the wild beasts;<br />
and secondly, in case of their prov-<br />
ing refractory, to defend them-<br />
selves against their attacks. The<br />
other tenants did something in the<br />
same way; some from one principle,<br />
and some from another. Peter Bull-<br />
frog, who was as cunning as any of<br />
them, made use of those which he<br />
had tamed as his caterers, to pro-<br />
vide game for his table, of which<br />
the feathers and furs served him as<br />
articles of traffic, and brought him<br />
in a profitable return.</p>

<p>The principal consideration (set-<br />
ting aside interest) which induced<br />
the more zealous of the Foresters<br />
to enter into this business, was an<br />
idea, that these animals were a de-<br />
generated part of the human spe-<br />
cies, and might be restored to their<br />
proper rank and order if due pains<br />
were taken. The grounds of this<br />
opinion were these: Among the tra-<br />
ditions of the ancient Druids there<br />
was a story, that out of <em>twelve</em> fa-<br />
milies which inhabited a certain dis-<br />
trict by themselves, <em>ten</em> had been<br />
lost, and no account could be given<br />
of them; and, where, said they, is it<br />
more likely to find them than in<br />
this forest, in the shape of some<br />
other creatures? especially, if the<br />
doctrine of transmigration, which<br />
the Druids held be true. Ano-<br />
ther tradition was, that one of Mr.<br />
Bull’s great great uncles, by the<br />
name of <em>Madok</em>, had many years<br />
ago disappeared, and the last ac-<br />
counts which had been received of<br />
him was, that he had been seen go-<br />
ing towards this forest; hence it<br />
was concluded that his descendants<br />
must be found there. In confirma-<br />
tion of this argument, it was al-<br />
leged, that the sounds which some<br />
of these creatures made in their<br />
howlings, resembled the language<br />
spoken in that day: nay, some were<br />
positive that they had heard them pro-<br />
nounce the word ([^43]) <em>Madokawando</em>;<br />
and one hunter roundly swore that<br />
he had seen in the den of a bear, an<br />
old <em>book</em> which he supposed to be a <br />
<em>Bible</em> written in the Celtic language,<br />
and this book they concluded must<br />
have been left there by Madok,<br />
who could read and speak no other<br />
language. Another very material<br />
circumstance was the discovery of a<br />
rock by the side of a brook, ([^44]) <br />
inscribed with some characters which<br />
bore no resemblance to any kind of<br />
writing, ancient or modern; the<br />
conclusion from hence was, that it<br />
must be of the remotest antiquity:<br />
this rock was deemed an unaccount-<br />
able curiosity, till a certain virtuoso<br />
took into his noddle, first to ima-<br />
gine, and then to become extremely<br />
positive that the characters were <em>Pu- *<br />
*nic</em>; and finally this inscription was<br />
translated, and affirmed to be no-<br />
thing less than a treaty of alliance<br />
between the <em>Phenicians</em> and the first<br />
inhabitants of this forest. From<br />
all these premises it was inferred,<br />
with some plausibility, and more<br />
positiveness that one species at least<br />
of the savage animals was descended<br />
from <em>Madok</em>, and that the others<br />
were the posterity of the long lost <br />
<em>ten</em> families, who were well known<br />
to have had a commercial connec-<br />
tion with the <em>Phenicians</em>, and that<br />
these probably found out their haunt,<br />
and followed them for the sake of<br />
their former friendship. What hap-<br />
py light do modern discoveries and<br />
conjectures thrown on the dark pages<br />
of antiquity!</p>

<p>From these principles, as well as from<br />
motives of humanity and of interest,<br />
some of the Foresters entered with<br />
zeal on the consideration and pract-<br />
ice of the best methods to fulfil this<br />
condition of their grants, the disci-<br />
plining the savage animals, and they<br />
certainly deserve praise for their ho-<br />
nest endeavours; but, others who<br />
pretended to the same zeal, it is to<br />
be lamented, made use of this pre-<br />
tence to cover their vanity or their<br />
avarice. Had none but gentle<br />
means been used, it is probable<br />
more good might, on the whole,<br />
have been produced; but as it often<br />
happens that many a good project<br />
has been ruined for want of pru-<br />
dence in the execution, so it fared<br />
with this; for while the new comers<br />
were busy in putting up their huts,<br />
and preparing the land for cultiva-<br />
tion, (both which were necessary<br />
before they could attend to any<br />
other business) some of the savage<br />
tribe would be a little impertinent,<br />
either by peeping into the huts, or<br />
breaking up a nest where the poul-<br />
try were hatching, or carrying off a<br />
chick or a gosling. These imperti-<br />
nencies bred frequent quarrels, and<br />
the poor creatures were sometimes<br />
driven off with bloody noses, or<br />
obliged to hop on three legs, or<br />
even laid sprawling and slyly cover-<br />
ed with earth, no service or ceremo-<br />
ny being said over the carcase, and<br />
no other epitaph than “Poh, they<br />
are nothing but brutes, and where’s<br />
the harm of killing them!” or in<br />
rhyme thus:\</p>

<p>“Tit for tat, tit for tat,\
“He stole my chick and I broke his back.”<br />
Whatever plausible excuses might<br />
have been made for these proceed-<br />
ings, they served to render the<br />
other creatures jealous of their new<br />
neighbors; but instead of abating<br />
their appetite for mischief, it sharp-<br />
ened their invention to take more<br />
sly methods of accomplishing it.<br />
The more wary of them kept aloof<br />
in the day time, and would not be<br />
enticed by the arts which were used<br />
to draw them in; however, they<br />
were sometimes pinched for food,<br />
and the new inhabitants used to<br />
throw crusts of bread, handfuls of corn,<br />
and other eatables, in<br />
their way, which allured them by<br />
degrees to familiarity. After a<br />
while it was found that nothing suc-<br />
ceeded so well as <em>melasses</em>: it was<br />
therefore thought a capital manoeu-<br />
vre to drop a train of it on the<br />
ground, which the creatures would<br />
follow, licking it, till they had in-<br />
sensibly got up to the doors of the<br />
houses, where, if any body held a<br />
bowl or a plate besmeared with the<br />
liquor, they would come and put<br />
their noses into it, and then you<br />
might pat them on the back<br />
and sides, or stroke them, say-<br />
ing, “poor Bruin, poor Isgrim,<br />
poor Reynard, poor Puss,” and the<br />
like, and they should suffer them-<br />
selves to be handled and fondled till<br />
they dropped asleep. When they<br />
awaked they would make a moan<br />
and wag their tails as if they were<br />
asking for more, and if it was de-<br />
nied them, they would retire to the<br />
woods in disgust, till the scent of<br />
the melasses operating on their de-<br />
praved appetites, invited them to<br />
return where it was to be had. This<br />
was upon repeated trial found to be<br />
the most effectual way of taming<br />
them, as they might be taught to<br />
imitate any kind of tricks and ges-<br />
tures if a dish of melasses was held<br />
out as a reward.</p>

<p>The Foresters knew that they<br />
could not ingratiate themselves bet-<br />
ter with their old master Bull, than<br />
by humouring his itch for pro-<br />
jects. They therefore took care to<br />
raise reports and write letters from<br />
time to time concerning the won-<br />
derful success which they had met<br />
with in civilizing the savage animals.<br />
Bull was greatly pleased with these<br />
reports, and made a practice of send-<br />
ing presents of trinkets to be dis-<br />
tributed among them; such as col-<br />
lars, ear-rings, and nose-jewels. Se-<br />
veral times some of the most stately<br />
and best instructed of them were car-<br />
ried to his house for a show, where<br />
he had them dressed up in scarlet<br />
and gold trappings, and led through<br />
all his apartments for the entertain-<br />
ment of his family, and feasted with<br />
every nick-nack which his cook<br />
and confectioner could procure.<br />
He was so fond of being thought<br />
their patron and protector, that he<br />
usually spoke of them as his <em>red *<br />
*children</em>, from the colour of their<br />
hides. It is not many years since<br />
one of them, after being led through<br />
several families and plantations of<br />
the tenants, was carried home to<br />
Mr. Bull’s own house, dressed in<br />
the habit of a <em>clergyman</em>, having<br />
been previously taught to lift his<br />
paw and roll his eyes as if in the act<br />
of devotion. This trick was so well<br />
carried on that the managers of it<br />
picked up a large pocket full of<br />
pence, by exhibiting him for a raree-<br />
show, and the money was applied<br />
toward building a <em>menagerie</em>, where<br />
beasts of all kinds might be brought<br />
and tamed. This project, like ma-<br />
ny such whims, has proved of more<br />
profit to the projectors, than bene-<br />
fit to the public; for most of those<br />
who were supposed to be tamed and<br />
domesticated, after they had been<br />
sent back to their native woods<br />
with a view to their being instru-<br />
mental in taming their fellow-sa-<br />
vages, have returned to their former<br />
ferocious habits, and some of them<br />
have proved greater rogues than<br />
ever, and have done more mischief<br />
than they could otherwise have been<br />
capable of.</p>

<p>Mr. Bull himself was once so full<br />
of the project, that he got his chap-<br />
lain and some others to form them-<br />
selves into a club ([^45]), the professed<br />
object of which was to propagate<br />
knowledge among these savage crea-<br />
tures. After some trials which did<br />
not answer expectation, old madam<br />
Bull conceived that the money which<br />
was collected might as well be ex-<br />
pended in teaching Mr. Bull’s own<br />
tenants themselves a little better<br />
manners; for some of them were ra-<br />
ther awkward and slovenly in their<br />
deportment, while others were de-<br />
cent and devout <em>in their own way</em>.<br />
Madam, as we have before obser-<br />
ved, was a great zealot in the cause<br />
of <em>uniformity</em>, and had a vast influ-<br />
ence over her son, by virtue of which<br />
the attention of the club was prin-<br />
cipally directed to the promoting<br />
this grand object. Accordingly,<br />
every one of the tenants was fur-<br />
nished with a bible and a prayer-<br />
book, a clean napkin, bason, platter<br />
and chalice, with a few devotional<br />
tracts, and some young adventurers<br />
who had been educated in the fami-<br />
ly, were recommended as chaplains;<br />
who had also by-orders to keep a<br />
look out toward the savage animals,<br />
when they should fall in their way.<br />
The chaplains were tolerably well<br />
received in most of the families;<br />
but some, particularly Codline and<br />
Ploughshare, who gloried in being<br />
able to say <em>without book</em>, always<br />
looked sour upon them, and would<br />
frequently say to them, “Go, take<br />
care of the savage objects of your<br />
mission, and don’t come here to<br />
teach us, ‘till you have learned bet-<br />
ter yourselves.” The chaplains in<br />
disgust, and perhaps in revenge (for<br />
they were but men of like passions)<br />
would pout and swell and call <em>schis- *<br />
*matic</em> and other canonical nick-<br />
names, of which there is extant a<br />
large vocabulary, and would fre-<br />
quently write letters, much to the<br />
disadvantage of their opponents. It<br />
is not many years since they, with<br />
the club which sent them, were pret-<br />
ty severely handled by one of Cod-<br />
line’s own Chaplains, and it is sup-<br />
posed that they have ever since been<br />
abating their arrogance; certain it<br />
is that they are on better terms <em>now</em> <br />
with their neighbors than ever;<br />
this may, in part, be owing to some<br />
other circumstances, but be the cause<br />
what it may, it is looked upon by<br />
the judicious, as one of the most<br />
hopeful among the signs of the times.</p>

<p>[6. November 1787]</p>

<p>The FORESTERS,\</p>

<p><em>An</em> AMERICAN TALE, <em>being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the
Clothier.</em></p>

<p>[<em>Continued from page 710.</em>]</p>

<p>It has been observed, that the<br />
lease which Mr. Bull gave to <br />
<em>Charles Indigo</em>, obliged him to re-<br />
ceive into his family all such persons<br />
as had been attendants on Mr. Bull<br />
during his sickness, and for whom<br />
he had no other means of provid-<br />
ing. This general indulgence pro-<br />
cured to Charles the reputation of<br />
a very friendly, hospitable person,<br />
and induced great numbers of other<br />
people of various characters, views,<br />
and interests, to seek an assylum<br />
within his limits. About this time<br />
old Lewis had grown sick and pee-<br />
vish, and had severely cudgelled<br />
some of his apprentices, because they<br />
did not make their P’s and Q’s ex-<br />
actly to his mind ([^46]). The poor<br />
fellows, to prevent worse treatment,<br />
fled from his house, and took refuge<br />
with Mr. Bull, who treated them<br />
civilly, and recommended them<br />
to the Forest, where they dispersed<br />
in the several families of his tenants,<br />
and a large party of them took up<br />
their abode with Charles, to whose<br />
family they proved an industrious,<br />
profitable acquisition, though some<br />
of the family looked a little sourly upon them.<br />
This facility of admitting strangers<br />
produced an effect which had almost<br />
proved fatal to the reputation of the<br />
family; for a number of highway-<br />
men ([^47]) also sought shelter there,<br />
and by means of their gold and sil-<br />
ver, which they had in plenty, made<br />
friends in the house, and were ad-<br />
mitted by night at a back door.<br />
After a while they grew more bold<br />
and came in the day time, under<br />
the disguise of pedlars, with packs<br />
on their shoulders. One of them<br />
actually took his stand behind a cor-<br />
ner of one of the fences, from<br />
whence he sallied out on travellers;<br />
this corner obtained, from that cir-<br />
cumstance, the name of <em>Point-Fear</em>,<br />
and as the first names of places are<br />
not easily got rid of, it retains the<br />
name to this day, and perhaps will<br />
ever retain it. Here the rascal in-<br />
tended to have built himself a lodge,<br />
and taken up his quarters for life;<br />
but the matter was now grown so<br />
public, that Charles, for the honour<br />
of his family, ordered all stragglers<br />
to be seized, and this fellow in par-<br />
ticular, after a severe struggle, was<br />
apprehended and brought to justice.<br />
The same spot was afterward tak-<br />
en possession of by <em>Peter Pitch</em>, ([^48]) <br />
a poor fellow who got his living as<br />
he did his name, from collecting the<br />
resinous juice of the numerous pines<br />
which grew thereabouts. He had<br />
to work hard and fare hard, and go<br />
a great way for his victuals and<br />
clothes; but after he had lived alone<br />
for some time, he picked up one<br />
or two acquaintances of his own stamp,<br />
and they formed a family which was<br />
at first rather disorderly. Farther<br />
discovery of the lands, and the ad-<br />
vantage of the water-carriage, in-<br />
duced some other people to sit down<br />
by him, and in process of time he<br />
became so respectable as to be no-<br />
ticed by Mr. Bull, who, though he<br />
never gave him a lease in form, yet<br />
let him have cloth and haberdashery<br />
upon credit, and took his pitch in<br />
payment as fast as he could collect<br />
it. This kept him in a dependent<br />
state, and subjected him to impo-<br />
sitions from Bull’s clerks and jour-<br />
neymen. It is not many years since<br />
Bull sent him a taylor to <em>try-on</em> a<br />
new coat, ([^49]) which was so strait<br />
that it split in several places, and<br />
never could be altered so as to fit<br />
him, but he was obliged to wear it<br />
rather than quarrel with his patron.<br />
This same taylor was remarkable for <br />
<em>cabbaging</em>, as Peter Bull-Frog and<br />
Humphry Ploughshare have since had<br />
large experience.</p>

<p>To finish what relates to Charles<br />
Indigo, we shall observe, that the<br />
land on which he began his planta-<br />
tion, was in general so wet and miry,<br />
that it was unfavourable to the pro-<br />
duction of wheat, and it was for<br />
some time doubtful whether he<br />
would be able to raise his own bread.<br />
Chance at length effected what la-<br />
bour and ingenuity could not: a<br />
bird of passage having dropped some<br />
kernels of rice in his dung it was<br />
found to thrive exceedingly well;<br />
from whence the hint was taken,<br />
and rice became the standard grain<br />
of the plantation. By the cultiva-<br />
tion of this, and of a weed which<br />
was useful to the dyers; he grew<br />
rich, and made a sightly figure<br />
among his neighbours in point of<br />
dress and equipage, though his<br />
countenance is rather sallow, and<br />
he is subject to frequent returns of<br />
the intermittent fever.</p>

<p>By the extensive lease given to In-<br />
digo and his associates, most of Mr.<br />
Bull’s dependants and attendants<br />
were provided for, and their services<br />
recompensed with a shew of gene-<br />
rosity on his part, and of satisfac-<br />
tion on theirs. We have before just<br />
hinted at a grant made to <em>William *<br />
*Broad Brim</em> ([^50]), of which we shall<br />
give a more particular account.<br />
His father had been an old ser-<br />
vant of Mr. Bull, and had been em-<br />
ployed in the very laborious and ne-<br />
cessary business of catching and<br />
killing rats. In this employment<br />
he was so very dexterous and suc-<br />
cessful that he recommended him-<br />
self highly to his master, who not<br />
only allowed him large wages<br />
but promised him farther recompense.<br />
During Mr. Bull’s sickness, the<br />
care and diligence of this faithful<br />
servant had been unremitted and his<br />
merits were thereby increased, so<br />
that Mr. Bull on his recovery found<br />
himself deeply indebted to him, and<br />
he still continued his services; till,<br />
worn out with age and infirmity,<br />
he died and had an honorable fu-<br />
neral.</p>

<p>His son William then became his<br />
heir, and solicited for payment of<br />
the arrears due to his father, which<br />
Mr. Bull, according to the maxim<br />
he had laid down for himself, and<br />
urged by the necessity of the occa-<br />
sion, proposed to discharge by a<br />
lease of part of the Forest. This<br />
happened to fall in, exactly, with<br />
William’s views, which were of a<br />
singular nature.</p>

<p>About this time a nervous dis-<br />
order appeared in Bull’s family<br />
which went by the name of the<br />
([^51]) <em>shaking palsy</em>. We shall not<br />
pretend to trace the causes of it,<br />
as the origin of such things is often<br />
obscure and impenetrable; but the<br />
effects were, a trembling of the<br />
nerves, a stiffness in the neck and<br />
shoulders, and a hesitancy in the<br />
speech, so that it was impossible<br />
for the patients to pronounce cer-<br />
tain words and syllables, such as<br />
Sir, Madam, your honor, my lord,<br />
&amp;c. nor could one of them raise his<br />
hand to take off his hat, or hold it<br />
up when an oath was to be admi-<br />
nistered.</p>

<p>Mr. Bull’s choleric temper misin-<br />
terpreted this natural infirmity into<br />
a sullen disrespect. When he found<br />
a change in the behaviour of these<br />
domestics; that instead of bowing to<br />
him they stood upright as a May-<br />
pole, and instead of sir, and your ho-<br />
nor, they could utter nothing but <br />
<em>Friend</em>, he grew angry, and made a<br />
pretty free use of his fist, and when<br />
he found that they could not be<br />
cured by such means, he thrust some<br />
of them into a dark closet, and shut<br />
them up till they should (as he<br />
termed it) “learn better manners;”<br />
and it is supposed he would have car-<br />
ried his resentment much further,<br />
but for this circumstance; William<br />
Broadbrim, who had himself strong<br />
symptoms of the disorder, whispered<br />
to Mr. Bull, that if he would give<br />
him time to ripen a project, which<br />
he had conceived, he would rid him<br />
of all trouble with these people.<br />
William had a plodding genius, and<br />
the scheme with which his head was<br />
pregnant at this time, was nothing<br />
more or less than to make a settle-<br />
ment in the forest, and take all these<br />
people with him. Bull, who was<br />
glad to get rid of them, and of the<br />
debt which he owed to William,<br />
readily fell in with the project; and<br />
a grant was made out under hand<br />
and seal, wherein William Broad-<br />
brim, and his heirs, were invested<br />
with the right of soil, and all other<br />
privileges of proprietorship, in a cer-<br />
tain part of the forest, between the<br />
plantation of Frederic Marygold,<br />
and that of Cart-rut and Bare-clay,<br />
being in the neighborhood of the<br />
spot where Casimir had rebuilt his<br />
hut, and lived in an ambiguous situ-<br />
ation, not knowing who was his<br />
landlord. With him William made<br />
a peaceable compromise, saying,<br />
“Friend, I will do thee no violence,<br />
there is room enough for us both.”<br />
Casimir was glad of so good a neigh-<br />
bor, and he had reason to be, for<br />
he throve more rapidly after this<br />
than before.</p>

<p>William pitched upon a level<br />
piece of ground, where two large<br />
brooks met, for the situation of his<br />
mansion-house, and went to work to<br />
draw up rules for the government<br />
of his family. One of which was,<br />
that no person should be refused<br />
admittance into it, or disturbed<br />
in it, or cast out of it, on ac-<br />
count of any natural infirmity.<br />
Another was, that no arms, nor<br />
ammunition, should ever be made<br />
use of on any pretence whatever.<br />
The first of these rules gained Wil-<br />
liam great reputation among all sen-<br />
sible men; the latter was a notion<br />
which candor would lead us to sup-<br />
pose proceeded partly from the dis-<br />
order of his nerves, and partly from<br />
a love of peace, and the exercise of<br />
good will toward his fellow crea-<br />
tures.</p>

<p>When any of William’s neigh-<br />
bors, who were of a different way<br />
of thinking, spake to him of the im-<br />
policy of this rule, and asked him how<br />
he expected to defend himself and his<br />
family against the wild beasts, if<br />
they should attack him; William,<br />
(who was fond of harangue) would<br />
answer thus–“There is in all crea-<br />
tures a certain instinct, which dis-<br />
poseth them to peace. This instinct<br />
is so strong and fixed, that upon it,<br />
as upon a foundation, may be erect-<br />
ed a complete system of love and<br />
concord, which all the powers of<br />
anarchy shall not be able to over-<br />
throw. To cultivate and improve<br />
this instinct is the business of every<br />
wise man, and he may reasonably<br />
expect that an example of this kind,<br />
if steadily and regularly adhered to,<br />
will have a very extensive and bene-<br />
ficial influence, on all sorts of crea-<br />
tures; even the wild beasts of the fo-<br />
rest will become tame as the lambs,<br />
and birds of prey as harmless as<br />
doves. Dost thou not see, friend,<br />
what influence my example has al-<br />
ready had on those creatures which<br />
are deemed savage? I go into their<br />
dens with safety, and they enter my<br />
habitation without fear. When<br />
they are hungry I feed them, when<br />
they are thirsty I give them drink,<br />
and they in return bear my burdens,<br />
and do such other kind offices<br />
as they are capable of, and I require of<br />
them. I have even tamed some of<br />
them so far, that they have sold me<br />
the land on which they live, and<br />
have acknowledged the bargain by<br />
a mark made with their toe-nails on<br />
parchment. They are certainly<br />
some of the best natured creatures<br />
in the world; their native instinct<br />
leads them to love and peace, and<br />
sociability, and as long as I set<br />
them a good example I have no<br />
doubt they will follow it. When<br />
such is my opinion and expectation,<br />
why should I be anxious about what<br />
may, and I trust never will happen?<br />
Why should I put myself in a pos-<br />
ture of defence against those who<br />
will never attack me? or, why<br />
should I by the appearance of jea-<br />
lousy and distrust on my part, of-<br />
fend those who now put confidence<br />
in me? No, No, I will not suppose<br />
that they will ever hurt me. I will<br />
not suffer the <em>carnal weapon</em> to be<br />
seen in my house, nor shall one of<br />
my family ever learn the detestable<br />
practice of pulling the trigger. I<br />
leave the instruments of destruction<br />
to the offspring of Cain and the seed<br />
of the serpent; while I meekly imi-<br />
tate the gentleness of the lamb, and<br />
the innocence of the dove.”</p>

<p>With such harangues William<br />
would frequently entertain himself<br />
and his friends, and he was so san-<br />
guine in his benevolent project, that<br />
instead of having his own name (as was<br />
usual) written over his door, he had<br />
the words BROTHERLY LOVE, trans-<br />
lated into a foreign language, and<br />
inscribed in golden characters, as<br />
a standing invitation to persons<br />
of all nations and characters to<br />
come and take shelter under his<br />
roof.</p>

<p>The FORESTERS:\</p>

<p><em>An</em> AMERICAN TALE, <em>being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the
Clothier.</em></p>

<p>[<em>Continued from page 741.</em>]</p>

<p>The general invitation which<br />
William Broadbrim had gi-<br />
ven to all persons who were desti-<br />
tute of a home, to come and take<br />
shelter under his roof, and the gen-<br />
tle humane treatment which those<br />
who accepted the invitation met<br />
with, spread his fame abroad,<br />
and brought him much company. His<br />
family was sometimes compared to<br />
the Ark of Noah, because there<br />
was scarcely any kind of human<br />
being, of whatever shape, size, com-<br />
plexion, disposition, language or<br />
religion, but what might be found<br />
there. He had also the art to keep<br />
them pretty well employed. Indu-<br />
stry, frugality, and œconomy, were<br />
the leading principles of his family,<br />
and their thriving was in a ratio<br />
compounded of these three forces.<br />
Nothing was wanting to make them<br />
as happy a family as any in the<br />
world, but a disposition among<br />
themselves, to live in peace. Un-<br />
luckily, however, this desirable<br />
blessing, on account of the variety<br />
of their humours and interests, was<br />
seldom found among them. Am-<br />
bition, jealousy, avarice, and party<br />
spirit, had frequent out-breakings,<br />
and were with difficulty quelled. It<br />
is needless to enter into a very par-<br />
ticular discussion of the grounds or<br />
effects of these dissentions: family-<br />
quarrels are not very entertaining<br />
either at home or abroad, unless to<br />
such as delight in scandal, and it is<br />
presumed the readers of this narra-<br />
tive are not of that number. But<br />
there was one cause of dissention<br />
which it would be improper not to<br />
notice, because we have already<br />
hinted at the principle from which<br />
it proceeded. William’s aversion<br />
to fire arms was so strong, that he<br />
would not suffer any of his family<br />
to molest the wild inhabitants of<br />
the forest, though they were ever<br />
so mischievous. While the family<br />
was small, the savage animals who<br />
lived in the neighborhood being<br />
well fed, were tolerably tame and<br />
civil, but when the encreased num-<br />
ber of the family had penetrated<br />
farther into the forest, the haunts of<br />
the natives were disturbed and the<br />
straggling labourers were sometimes<br />
surprised, and having nothing to<br />
defend themselves with, fell a sa-<br />
crifice to savage resentment. Re-<br />
monstrances were presented to Mr.<br />
Broadbrim one after another, but<br />
he always insisted on it that the suf-<br />
ferer must have been the aggressor,<br />
and that “they who take the<br />
sword must expect to perish by the<br />
sword.” At length the dead corpse<br />
of one of the labourers, mangled<br />
and torn in a dreadful manner, was<br />
brought and laid at the door of<br />
William’s parlour ([^52]) with a label<br />
affixed to the breast, on which were<br />
written these words, “Thou thy-<br />
self must be accounted my murder-<br />
er, because thou didst deny me the<br />
means of defence.” At sight of<br />
this horrid spectacle, Broadbrim<br />
turned pale! The eye of his mind<br />
looked inward! Nature began to<br />
plead her own cause within him!<br />
he gave way in some degree to her<br />
operations, though contrary to his<br />
pre-conceived opinion, and with a<br />
trembling hand signed a permission<br />
for those to use the ([^53]) <em>carnal wea- *<br />
*pon</em>, who could do it without scru-<br />
ple; and when they asked him for<br />
money to buy guns, powder and<br />
ball, he gave them a certain sum to<br />
provide <em>the necessaries of life</em>, leav-<br />
ing them to put their own construc-<br />
tion on the words. By degrees<br />
his squeamishness grew less public,<br />
and though it is imagined he has<br />
still some remainder of it, yet ne-<br />
cessity has so often overcome it<br />
that there is not much said on the<br />
subject, unless it be very privately<br />
and among <em>friends</em>.</p>

<p>During the time of which we<br />
have been speaking Mr. John Bull<br />
had undergone another sickness ([^54]),<br />
not so long nor so violent as the<br />
former but much more beneficial in<br />
its effects. His new physicians had<br />
administered medicines which com-<br />
posed his nerves, he eat, drank<br />
and slept more regularly, and conversed<br />
more frequently with his wife ([^55])<br />
than heretofore. By these means<br />
his vigour was renewed, but still<br />
his whimsical disposition remained,<br />
and broke out on several occasions.<br />
When he viewed his extensive for-<br />
est, now planted and thriving, un-<br />
der the honest hand of industry, he<br />
thought within himself that still<br />
greater advantages might be derived<br />
from that territory. There was<br />
yet a part of it unsettled between<br />
the plantation of Charles Indigo,<br />
and the dominions of Lord Strut;<br />
and Bull thought it a pity to let so<br />
much remain a wilderness. The<br />
other plantations had been made by<br />
discontented servants and needy ad-<br />
venturers who struggling with hard-<br />
ships, by a steady perseverance had<br />
surmounted many difficulties, and<br />
obtained a comfortable living.<br />
“Now (said Bull) if these fellows<br />
have done so well, and got so far<br />
aforehand, without having any ca-<br />
pital of their own to begin with,<br />
what cannot be done by the force<br />
of my great capital? If they have<br />
performed such wonders, what great-<br />
er wonders may be brought into<br />
view by my own exertions, with all<br />
the advantages which it is in my<br />
power to command? To it, boys,<br />
I vow I’ll have a farm of my own<br />
that shall beat you all!”–Having<br />
conceived this project, his brains<br />
immediately became pregnant with<br />
ideas; but according to the rule<br />
which he had lately prescribed to<br />
himself he communicated the matter<br />
to his wife. This good lady, though<br />
prudent, was not free from a ro-<br />
mantic turn of mind. She was ex-<br />
tremely fond of having it thought<br />
that she had great influence over her<br />
husband, and would sometimes gra-<br />
tify his humour at the expense of her<br />
own judgment, rather than not<br />
keep up this idea. His expectations<br />
from his new project were very san-<br />
guine. The land on which he had<br />
cast his eye was enough for a large<br />
farm; it had a southern exposure,<br />
it was warm, rich and fertile in some<br />
parts, and in others boggy or sandy.<br />
He had conversed with some fo-<br />
reigners, who told him that it was<br />
proper for the cultivation of wine<br />
and silk, and he imagined that if<br />
he could but add these articles to<br />
the list of his own productions, there<br />
would be a great saving in the fa-<br />
mily. Mrs. Bull too was pleased<br />
with the idea of having her silk<br />
gowns and ribbands of her own<br />
growth, and with the expectation of<br />
having the vaults filled with wine,<br />
made on her own plantation; for<br />
these and other good reasons, her<br />
thereunto moving, madam gave her<br />
consent to the project. The person<br />
appointed to carry it into execution<br />
was <em>George Trusty</em>, ([^56]) a sensible<br />
well-bred merchant, but one who<br />
had only speculated in the science<br />
of agriculture, and knew nothing<br />
of it by experience. Having col-<br />
lected a number of poor people who<br />
were out of employment, he sent<br />
them to the spot, with strict orders<br />
to work fix days in seven, to keep<br />
their tools free from rust, and their<br />
fire-arms in readiness for their de-<br />
fence; whatever they should earn<br />
was to be their own as long as they<br />
lived, and after their death their<br />
possessions were to descend to their<br />
<em>sons</em>, and in default of male issue<br />
to revert to the original grantor.<br />
They were not allowed to use black<br />
cattle in the labour of the field;<br />
and were expressly forbidden to<br />
drink grog. Their business<br />
was to cultivate vines and mulberry<br />
trees, and to manufacture wine and<br />
silk. Upon this project another<br />
was grafted by the very sagacious<br />
<em>Doctor Squintum</em>, who chose this<br />
new plantation as the most conve-<br />
nient spot in the world for a charity<br />
school, where <em>Orphans</em> might re-<br />
ceive the best education and be fit-<br />
ted to be the pillars of church and<br />
state.</p>

<p>But notwithstanding the sums<br />
which Bull so freely lavished out<br />
of his bags for the support of the vine<br />
and mulberry plantations; and not-<br />
withstanding the collections which<br />
Squintum made among his nume-<br />
rous devotees, these projects were<br />
either so impracticable in them-<br />
selves, or so ill conducted in the ex-<br />
ecution, that neither of them answer-<br />
ed the expectations of the project-<br />
ors. For want of black cattle the<br />
soil could not be properly tilled,<br />
and for want of grog the labourers<br />
fainted at their work; the right of<br />
inheritance being limited to the<br />
male line, women and girls were<br />
not fond of living there, and the<br />
men could not well live without<br />
them; land, cattle, women and<br />
grog, were to be had elsewhere,<br />
and who would be confined to such<br />
a place? The land too, was claimed<br />
by Lord Strut, who sent them<br />
writs of ejectment. The Charity-<br />
School dwindled to nothing and<br />
was consumed by fire. Poor George<br />
Trusty was discouraged and begged<br />
Mr. Bull to take the plantation in-<br />
to his own hands, however Bull<br />
kept supplying him with cash and<br />
he kept making attempts. Altera-<br />
tions were made in the terms of<br />
settlement, the restrictions were re-<br />
moved, cattle and grog were al-<br />
lowed, Lord Strut was ousted<br />
and possession held; the swamps<br />
were drained; rice and indigo were<br />
cultivated instead of silk and wine,<br />
and upon the whole, considerable im-<br />
provements were made, though at<br />
such a vast expense that Mr. Bull<br />
never saw any adequate returns.<br />
The ill-success of this adventure,<br />
did not deter him from another pro-<br />
ject. He was extremely fond of <br />
<em>Trout</em> ([^57]) and thought if he could<br />
have them regularly catched and<br />
brought to his table, he should ex-<br />
ceed all his neighbours in delicate<br />
living, and now and then be able to<br />
send a mess to his particular friends.<br />
Lord Peter’s family too, he thought<br />
would be glad to buy them as they<br />
were very useful in the long lents,<br />
and frequent meagre days observed by<br />
them. There was a part of the<br />
forest on the north-east quarter,<br />
which was very conveniently situa-<br />
ted for this employment. ([^58]) It<br />
had been occupied by <em>Alexander *<br />
*Scotus</em>, a purblind fellow, who had<br />
straggled thither no one could<br />
tell how, and it was matter of<br />
doubt whether he derived his right<br />
from Bull or Lewis, for both of<br />
them laid claim to the land, and<br />
their claims had not been fairly<br />
decided in law. To make sure of<br />
the matter, Mr. Bull, by advice of<br />
his wife, sent thither ([^59]) a parcel of<br />
naked half starved people, who could<br />
live no where else, and supported<br />
them for several years with provisi-<br />
ons, furnished them with skiffs,<br />
lines, hooks and other implements<br />
to carry on the fishery; but every<br />
trout which they catched, cost him<br />
ten times as much as if he had<br />
bought it in the common market;<br />
nor could he after all get half of<br />
what he wanted for his own con-<br />
sumption. His trout-fishery, and<br />
his mulberry plantation, rendered<br />
him the laughing-stock of his neigh-<br />
bours, nor could he ever gain even<br />
the interest of the money he had<br />
laid out upon them; while the fo-<br />
resters who had settled at their own<br />
expense grew rich and became res-<br />
pectable. He had indeed, the be-<br />
nefit of their trade, which kept his<br />
journeymen at work, and obliged<br />
him to enlarge their number; for<br />
the foresters had a respect for their<br />
old master and landlord, and when<br />
they had any thing to sell they al-<br />
ways let him have the refusal of it,<br />
and bought all their goods of him.<br />
But though he called himself their<br />
father, and his wife their mother,<br />
yet it is thought he never entertain-<br />
ed a proper parental affection for<br />
them; but rather looked on them<br />
with a jealous eye, as if they were<br />
aiming to deprive him of his claim<br />
and set up for independence. Had<br />
he been contented with the profits<br />
of their trade, as was certainly his<br />
interest, they might have remained<br />
his tenants to this day; but ambi-<br />
tion, avarice, jealousy and choler,<br />
inflamed by bad counsellors, have<br />
wrought such a separation, that it<br />
is thought Mr. Bull will go mourning<br />
all the remainder of his days, and<br />
his grey hairs will be brought down<br />
with sorrow to the grave.</p>

<p>The FORESTERS,\</p>

<p><em>An</em> AMERICAN TALE, *being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the</p>

<p>Clothier.*</p>

<p>[<em>Continued from</em> vol. i. <em>page</em> 793.]</p>

<p>In the preceding part of this his-<br />
tory we have endeavoured, to trace<br />
the several steps by which the forest be-<br />
came cultivated and peopled. Mr.<br />
Bull had no less than fourteen tenants<br />
who held under him, and were settled<br />
on lands which he claimed as his own,<br />
and which he had granted to them in<br />
separate parcels. Their names were as<br />
follows, beginning at the north-east, and<br />
proceeding to the south-west:</p>

<p>Alexander Scotus, N. S.\<br />
Robert Lumber, N. H.\<br />
John Codline, M.\<br />
Roger Carrier, R. I.\<br />
Humphrey Plough-share, C.\<br />
Peter Bull-Frog, N. Y.\<br />
Julius Caesar, N. J.\<br />
—- Casimir, D.\<br />
William Broad-brim, P.\<br />
Frederick Mary-gold, M.\<br />
Walter Pipe-weed, V.\<br />
Peter Pitch, N. C.\<br />
Charles Indigo, S. C.\<br />
George Trusty, G.</p>

<p>It was observed, that of all the ad-<br />
venturers, those generally were the<br />
<em>least thriving</em>, who received <em>most assist- *<br />
*ance</em> from their old master. Whether<br />
it was owing to their being employed<br />
in business to which they had not serv-<br />
ed a regular apprentice-ship, or to a<br />
natural indolence, and a disposition to<br />
continue hangers-on where they had<br />
got a good hold; for it must be noted,<br />
that Mr. Bull was very generous to<br />
some persons, and on some occasions<br />
where it suited his fancy, and this dis-<br />
position in him was so prevalent, that<br />
they who kenned him, and would hu-<br />
mor his whims, could work him out<br />
of any thing which they had a mind<br />
to [sic]</p>

<p>On the other hand, those adventu-<br />
rers who came into the forest on their<br />
own hook, and had no assistance at all<br />
from their old master, nor any thing to<br />
help themselves with, but their own<br />
heads and hands, proved to be the most<br />
industrious and thriving, and after a<br />
while told up a good estate. They all<br />
seemed to have an affection for Mr.<br />
Bull, and it was generally believed<br />
to be sincere. His house was usually<br />
spoken of by them as their <em>home</em>.<br />
His ware-house was the center of their<br />
traffic; and he had the address to en-<br />
gross the profits of their labour and<br />
draw their earnings into his own fob.<br />
To some of them he would now and<br />
then make a present, to others he would<br />
lend a ([^60]) pack of his hounds when he<br />
was out of the humor of hunting;<br />
but they were generally useless to<br />
them for the purpose of scouring the<br />
woods, those who could afford it kept<br />
dogs of their own, who were better<br />
trained to the game, and could better<br />
scent the forest, being native curs, and<br />
not so spruce and delicate a breed as<br />
Bull’s grey-hounds.</p>

<p>It has been before observed, that<br />
each end of the forest was occupied<br />
by Bull’s rivals. His old neighbour<br />
Lewis had got the north end, and<br />
Lord Strut the south. Bull’s tenants had<br />
seated themselves chiefly on or near<br />
the shore of the lake, and had not ex-<br />
tended very far back, because of the<br />
beasts of prey; but Lewis, like a cun-<br />
ning old fox, had formed a scheme to get<br />
footing in the interior parts of the<br />
country, and prevent these planters<br />
from penetrating beyond the limits<br />
which he intended to assign them. His<br />
emissaries had been sent slyly into the<br />
distant parts of the forest, under pre-<br />
tence of taming these beasts of prey;<br />
but in fact they had halved the matter<br />
with them, and had themselves become<br />
as savage as the beasts had become<br />
tame. They would run, leap and<br />
climb with them and crawl into their<br />
dens, imparting to them a lick of <em>me- *<br />
*lasses</em> out of their calabash, and teaching<br />
them to scratch with their paws the<br />
sign of a cross. They had built several<br />
hunting lodges on the most convenient<br />
passes of the brooks and ponds,<br />
and though thus scattered in the wood,<br />
were all united under one overseer,<br />
called ([^61]) <em>Onontio</em>, who lived in the<br />
mansion-house of <em>St. Lewis</em>’s Hall.<br />
It was matter of wonder among<br />
Bull’s tenants, for some time, what<br />
could be the reason that the wild beasts<br />
had grown more surly and snappish<br />
of late than formerly; but after a<br />
while, some hunters made a discovery<br />
of the new lodges, which the emissa-<br />
ries of Onontio had erected, and the<br />
design of them being apparent, a gene-<br />
ral alarm was raised in the plantations.<br />
On the first news, Walter Pipe-weed<br />
sent his grandson ([^62]) <em>George</em>, a smart,<br />
active, lively youth, across the hills,<br />
with his compliments to the intruders,<br />
desiring them to move off, and threat-<br />
ening them with a writ in case of non-<br />
compliance. This modest warning be-<br />
ing ineffectual, it was thought that if<br />
an <em>Union</em> could be formed among the<br />
tenants, they might make a stand a-<br />
gainst these encroachments. A meet-<br />
ing was held at ([^63]) <em>Orange-Hall</em>, but<br />
no efficient plan could be hit on, with-<br />
out a previous application to their land-<br />
lord, who hearing of this meeting,<br />
conceived a jealousy with regard to this<br />
<em>union</em> which seemed to be their object,<br />
and thought it was better to retain the<br />
management of the matter in his own<br />
hands, and keep them divided among<br />
themselves, but united in their depend-<br />
ence on him. He therefore sent them<br />
word that “he had a very great affect-<br />
“ tion for them, and would take care<br />
“ of <em>their</em> interest, which was also <em>his *<br />
“ *own</em>; that he would not suffer old<br />
“ Lewis to set his half-tamed wild<br />
“ beasts upon them, nor eject them<br />
“ from their possessions, but that he<br />
“ would immediately take advice of<br />
“ his council, learned in the law, con-<br />
“ juring them by the affection which<br />
“ they professed to bear towards him,<br />
“ to be aiding and assisting in all ways,<br />
“ in their power towards bringing the<br />
“ controversy to an issue.”</p>

<p>At this time, the Steward, to whom<br />
Mr. Bull entrusted the care of his bus-<br />
iness, was not a person of that discern-<br />
ment and expedition which the exigen-<br />
cy of affairs required. He had com-<br />
mitted divers blunders in his accounts,<br />
and it was suspected that he was a de-<br />
faulter in more respects than one. It<br />
cannot, therefore, be expected, that in<br />
conducting a controversy of this mag-<br />
nitude, he should exactly hit on the<br />
right methods, nor employ the best<br />
council which could be had. The<br />
first step which was taken was to send <br />
([^64]) <em>Broad-oak</em> the bailiff, with a writ<br />
of intrusion which he was ordered to<br />
serve <em>volens nolens</em> upon one of the<br />
messuages or hunting-seats of Lewis.<br />
This bailiff proceeding rashly and a-<br />
gainst the best advice into the forest,<br />
not a step of which he was acquainted<br />
with, found his progress impeded in a<br />
way wholly unexpected. For Onontio<br />
had taken care to place a number of<br />
his half tamed wild cats and wolverenes<br />
on the boughs of trees, which hung<br />
over the path, and as soon as the bailiff<br />
came within reach, having first wetted<br />
their tails with their own urine, they<br />
whisked it into his eyes till they blind-<br />
ed him. This manoeuvre put a stop to<br />
the process for that time.</p>

<p>Several other attempts of the like<br />
kind were made without success, and<br />
Lewis at one time had almost got pos-<br />
session of ([^65]) <em>Orange-Hall</em>. Not only<br />
the foresters themselves, but even<br />
Bull’s own domestics, complained bitter-<br />
ly of these ineffectual measures, and<br />
their clamors at last prevailed to<br />
make him discharge his old steward,<br />
and put another into his place. The<br />
new ([^66]) officer soon changed the face<br />
of affairs; he employed no attorneys,<br />
nor bailiffs, but those of tried and ap-<br />
proved abilities, men of enterprize and<br />
resolution, by whom the suit was pro-<br />
secuted in good earnest. In every ac-<br />
tion Bull recovered judgment, and got<br />
possession. When Lord Strut came in<br />
to the aid of Lewis, Bull cast him also,<br />
and took away his manor of Augustine,<br />
which with the whole tract of land,<br />
where Onontio presided, was annexed<br />
to his estate. The agents who had<br />
been employed in this arduous service,<br />
were not only well paid for doing their<br />
duty, but, with the steward, who em-<br />
ployed them, were honored according<br />
to the ancient, but whimsical custom of<br />
Bull’s family, by having their effigies<br />
portrayed on sign-boards, pocket-<br />
handkerchiefs, snuff-boxes, and punch-<br />
bowls; so that while the fit lasted, you<br />
could not walk the streets, nor blow<br />
your nose, nor take a pinch of snuff,<br />
nor a draught of punch, but you were<br />
obliged to <em>salute</em> them.</p>

<p>Whenever Bull’s steward called up-<br />
on the foresters for their quotas of aid,<br />
towards carrying on this heavy law-<br />
suit, they always readily afforded it;<br />
and some of them were really almost<br />
exhausted by the efforts which they<br />
made, to do <em>more</em> than their share. The<br />
steward was so sensible of their merit,<br />
that on due consultation with Mr.<br />
Bull’s wife, and her taking him in the<br />
right mood, he was prevailed upon to<br />
reimburse the extra expense to them,<br />
and mutual complacency reigned be-<br />
tween the landlord and tenants all the<br />
time this steward remained in office.<br />
But these times were too good to last<br />
long; there were some who envied<br />
him his reputation, and raised stories<br />
to his disadvantage, which highly af-<br />
fronted him. At this time Mr.<br />
Bull was so much off his guard, as to give<br />
heed to these reports, and take a rash<br />
step in a hurry, which he had occasion<br />
to repent of at his leisure. He accept-<br />
ed the resignation of this trusty ser-<br />
vant, and put one of his ([^67]) sister<br />
Peg’s cast-off footmen into his place;<br />
whereby he laid a foundation for his<br />
own disgrace, and the dismemberment<br />
of his estate, as the reader will see<br />
in the following pages of this history.</p>

<p>[9. April 1788]</p>

<p>The FORESTERS,\</p>

<p><em>An</em> AMERICAN TALE, <em>being a Sequel to the History of JOHN BULL the
Clothier.</em></p>

<p>[<em>Continued from page</em> 60.]</p>

<p>TO trace with precision all the<br />
causes, great and small, which<br />
operated to the dismemberment of<br />
John Bull’s estate, would be no<br />
easy task; some of them perhaps,<br />
were <em>secret</em>, but of such, as were open<br />
to observation, we shall endeavour<br />
to sketch out the principal.<br />
It is well known, that he was of a<br />
choleric habit, and that those who<br />
were acquainted with his humour and<br />
passions, could manage and impose<br />
upon him at their pleasure. Had<br />
he been let alone to pursue his own<br />
business <em>himself</em>, his plain, natural<br />
good sense, and generosity of mind,<br />
would have kept him clear of many<br />
difficulties; but he had his advisers,<br />
his hangers-on, his levee-hunters,<br />
his toad-eaters, and sycophants, for-<br />
ever about him, who, like a parcel<br />
of blood-suckers, could never have<br />
enough to glut their voracity.<br />
When the forest was first occupied<br />
by the tenants, Bull had a ([^68]) wife<br />
who minded her own domestic busi-<br />
ness, and did not concern herself<br />
with his landed interest. The<br />
leases and grants were made out in <br />
<em>his</em> name, and he was supposed to<br />
be the owner or proprietor; but<br />
the lady whom he now had, was very<br />
assuming, and insisted on having<br />
her hand in the management of <em>all</em><br />
his affairs. She visited the compt-<br />
ing-house, and made the clerks<br />
shew her their books; she over-<br />
haled the steward’s accounts,<br />
and inspected his correspondence;<br />
she not only looked after the rents<br />
and incomes of the forest, but even<br />
intruded into the household concerns<br />
of the tenants, and affected to call<br />
herself <em>their mother</em>, because she had<br />
taken some care of one or two of<br />
them in their first setting out, al-<br />
though most of them scarcely ever<br />
had seen her face, or had any ac-<br />
quaintance with her, but by hearsay.<br />
It must be observed, also, that<br />
this woman had engaged Mr. Bull<br />
in some expensive lawsuits, and<br />
speculations, which had got him<br />
deeply into <em>debt</em>, and he was obliged<br />
to hire money of usurers to carry<br />
her schemes into execution. Had<br />
she, at the same time, introduced that<br />
frugality and economy into the fa-<br />
mily, which her duty ought to have<br />
prompted her to, this debt might<br />
have been kept down, and the in-<br />
terest regularly paid; but the swarm<br />
of harpies which were continually<br />
about her, and the course of gamb-<br />
ling which was carried on under her<br />
connivance and direction, swallowed<br />
up all the profits of the trade, and<br />
incomes of the land, while the lux-<br />
ury and dissipation of the family in-<br />
creased in proportion, as the means<br />
of discharging the debt decreased.<br />
In short, Mr. Bull was reduced to<br />
that humiliating condition, which,<br />
by whatever fashionable name it may<br />
now go, was formerly called <em>petti-</em><br />
<em>coat-government</em>.</p>

<p>During the law-suit with Lewis<br />
and Lord Strut ([^69]) concerning the<br />
forest, there had been a great inter-<br />
course with the tenants. Many of<br />
Bull’s servants and retainers, who<br />
were employed as bailiffs and attor-<br />
nies, and their deputies, had been<br />
very conversant with them, and<br />
were entertained at their houses,<br />
where they always found whol-<br />
esome victuals, jolly fire sides, and<br />
warm beds. They took much no-<br />
tice of every thing that passed, ask-<br />
ed many questions, and made many<br />
remarks on the goodness of the<br />
land, the pleasant situation of the<br />
houses, the clean and thriving con-<br />
dition of the children, who were al-<br />
ways ready to wait them, to<br />
clean their boots, hold their stir-<br />
rups, open and shut the gates for<br />
them, and the like little necessary<br />
services, as well bred children in the<br />
country are wont. The remarks<br />
which these persons made, when<br />
they got home, favored rather of<br />
envy, than of gratitude or affection.<br />
Some of them would say “Those<br />
fellows live too well in the forest;<br />
they thrive too fast; the place is<br />
too good for them; they ought to<br />
know who is their master; they<br />
can afford to pay more rent;<br />
they ought to pay for the help they<br />
have had; if it had not been for<br />
Master Bull, and the assistance which<br />
he has lent them, they would have<br />
been turned out of doors; and now<br />
they are to reap the benefit of his<br />
exertions, while he (poor man) is<br />
to pay the cost.”</p>

<p>There were not wanting some, in<br />
the families of the Foresters them-<br />
selves, who had the meanness to<br />
crouch to these fellows, and suppli-<br />
cate their favour and interest with<br />
Mr. Bull, to recommend them to<br />
some posts of profit, as under-stew-<br />
ards, collectors of rent, clerks of<br />
receipts, and the like pretty offices.<br />
These beggarly curs would repeat<br />
the same language, and hold corres-<br />
pondence with the bailiffs, attornies,<br />
&amp;c. after they had got home.<br />
Whenever any trifling quarrel hap-<br />
pened in the families of the tenants,<br />
they would magnify it and fill their<br />
letters with complaints of the licen-<br />
tiousness of the people, and plead<br />
for a tighter hand to be held over<br />
them.</p>

<p>Such speeches as those were fre-<br />
quently made, and such letters read,<br />
in the hearing of Mr. Bull’s wife<br />
and steward. This grew by degrees<br />
to be the current language of the<br />
family, and Bull himself listened to<br />
it. His choler rose upon the occa-<br />
sion, and when his hangers-on ob-<br />
served it, they plied him with strong-<br />
er doses, till his jealousy and hatred<br />
were excited, and a complete revo-<br />
lution in his temper, with regard<br />
to his tenants, took place, agreea-<br />
bly to the most sanguine and male-<br />
volent wishes of his and their ene-<br />
mies.</p>

<p>The first effect of this change<br />
was, that his clerks were ordered<br />
to charge not only the prices of the<br />
goods, which the tenants should<br />
purchase, but to make them pay<br />
for the <em>paper</em> ([^70]) on which their<br />
bills of parcels and notes of hand<br />
were written, and that at a very<br />
exorbitant rate. This was so into-<br />
lerable an abuse, and withal so mean,<br />
pitiful, and beggarly an expedient<br />
to pick their pockets, that they<br />
held a meeting among themselves,<br />
and resolved not to buy any more<br />
of his goods, as long as this impo-<br />
sition lasted; and by way of con-<br />
tempt, they hanged and burned the<br />
effigies of the steward, and other<br />
persons who were suspected of hav-<br />
ing advised to these new measures.<br />
The resentment shewn by the te-<br />
nants on this occasion was quite un-<br />
expected. The secret favourers, and<br />
real authors of the mischief, began<br />
to be afraid that they had gone too<br />
far for the first attempt. Bull’s<br />
journeymen were in an uproar about<br />
it, left by the failure of his trade<br />
they should be out of bread; and<br />
to shorten the story, he was obliged<br />
to give up the point of making<br />
them pay for the paper, though <br />
<em>Madam</em> had the singular modesty to<br />
make a declaration, that it was a<br />
mere matter of <em>expediency</em>, and that<br />
SHE had the sole power and right<br />
of dominion over them, notwith-<br />
standing Mr. Bull’s <em>most gracious</em><br />
concession at that time. ([^71])<br />
This was considered by the te-<br />
nants as a most impudent and bare-<br />
faced assumption; for whatever<br />
rights Mr. Bull might pretend to<br />
have, as their old master and land-<br />
lord, yet they never had any idea<br />
of a <em>mistress</em> over them; and though<br />
they very complaisantly returned<br />
him their thanks for his present<br />
goodness, yet as they suspected<br />
that there was more mischief hatch-<br />
ing, they began to enquire more<br />
narrowly than ever into his right<br />
and title to the land, on which they<br />
lived. They looked over old parch-<br />
ments and memorandums, consulted<br />
council learned in the law, and after<br />
due deliberation, they were fully<br />
convinced, that <em>their own</em> title was,<br />
at least, as good as his, and that<br />
they had a right to refuse him any<br />
rent or acknowledgment, if it were<br />
prudent for them to exercise it.<br />
Mr . Bull’s jealousy was now en-<br />
creased with regard to their intenti-<br />
ons, and his scribbling retainers<br />
frequently accused them of ingrate-<br />
tude and disobedience, and a long pre-<br />
meditated design to set up for inde-<br />
pendence; a thing which they had<br />
not yet thought of, and probably<br />
never would, if this abusive treat-<br />
ment had not put it into their heads.<br />
But though by those means they<br />
were led into an enquiry, and a train<br />
of thinking, which were quite new<br />
to them; yet as old habits are not<br />
easily broken, and their affection for<br />
their master was very strong, they<br />
endeavoured, with a candor which<br />
did them honor, to transfer the<br />
blame from him to his wife and<br />
steward, to whose machinations they<br />
knew he was a dupe. These bad<br />
counsellors soon renewed their at-<br />
tempts in another shape, by raising<br />
the rent, and putting an advanced<br />
price upon the goods, and by means<br />
of additional clerks, packers, por-<br />
ters, watchmen, draymen, &amp;c. who<br />
were continually in waiting, and<br />
to all of whom fees were to be paid,<br />
the trade laboured under great em-<br />
barrassments, and some of the Fo-<br />
resters were quite discouraged, others<br />
were vexed and impatient, while<br />
some of the better tempered of them,<br />
endeavoured to persuade the rest to<br />
keep up the communication as long<br />
as they could. They were loth to<br />
quarrel with their old master, and<br />
yet could not pocket the affronts<br />
and abuses to which they were daily<br />
exposed.</p>

<p>During this sullen interval, many<br />
letters passed, many books and pre-<br />
cedents were examined, and much<br />
ink was shed, in a controversy,<br />
which, however incapable of a <em>deci- *<br />
*sion</em> in this way, might have been<br />
<em>compromised</em>, if Mr. Bull’s first<br />
thoughts had been as good as his<br />
second; but he was so completely<br />
under management, as not to see<br />
his true interest. It was a common<br />
saying among his neighbors, “John<br />
Bull’s wit comes afterward;” and<br />
in fact it did not come in this case,<br />
till too late, for, when a cause once<br />
gets into the law, there are so many<br />
quirks, evasions, demurs, and procras-<br />
tinations, that it is impossible to<br />
make a retreat, till one or both of<br />
the parties have severely smarted<br />
for their temerity.</p>
